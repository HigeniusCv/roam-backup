- Does it help to say sorry? 
    - Don't bother.  Just keep getting better
- Interpersonal norms / [Politeness Theory](<Politeness Theory.md>)
    - When I accidentally harm another person, it's almost inconceivable that I'll let it pass without acknowledging my responsibility. Formally, a legitimate apology seems to require a) owning responsibility, by saying what I did to cause harm; b) recognition of the impact upon the person to whom I owe an apology; and ideally, c) a commitment to repair that, either immediately or when a similar situation recurs in the future.
    - “Even a dog knows the difference between being kicked and being stumbled over.” Oliver Wendell Holmes
    - The non-apology apology takes the form of "I'm sorry that YOUR action made X worse than I intended." The blame sticks to you, either for misinterpretation, over-reaction, or making my faultless behavior __seem__ hurtful.
    - While apologies play an essential role in society, there are interpersonal situations where they only add damage. Serial apologizers, such as the notorious Harvey Weinstein, may habitually treat people miserably and then send flowers to paper over the damage. 
        - Even if all the boxes of a legitimate apology get checked, an apology may be undermined by selfishness.
        - Repairing one's self-image, rather than assuaging the damage done to the other, is one factor in any apology. Self-regard can be a healthy motive when it spurs reflection and public admission of responsibility. Responsibility is not truly owned if an apology seeks primarily to whitewash one's reputation.
    - Apologies may in some cases only make things worse. If the emotional damage is awkward or difficult for the victim to acknowledge, that argues against explicit verbalization.
        - Owing another person an apology does not create an obligation for the other to allow you to communicate it to them.
        - Restorative justice?
- **Should companies behave like people?**
- What should a company do when a breakdown in the brand promise causes some misfortune to a customer? The analogy with interpersonal dynamics intuitively suggests that some form an apology is owed. Cultural norms require acknowledging the harm as a step to repairing a relationship.
- Tech firms's scale generates inevitable software bugs. The logic of minimally viable products means disappointments occur for some portion of the captured market
- Let's get concrete. 
    - Transportation and delivery companies must quote a prediction, even though the vicissitudes of the physical world are vulnerable to unforeseen problems. Ride-hailing apps choose a granularity and degree of accuracy to surface. 
        - Uber & Lyft show a point estimate for when the car will arrive; for carpooling, variability was implied by showing a time range. This was bounded by two probabilities - the lower estimate is hit 50% of the time ("p50"), while the upper bound was expected to cover 95% of driver arrivals ("p95"). As a homework problem for those who've repeat experience, what probability do you intuit when you hail a ride? In other words, how frequently do you expect that a car arrives later than the quoted arrival time?
    - Five percent of customers are, by definition, going to get an experience that's worse than the best 95% of cases. 
        - Bounding the variance can keep the frequency of a truly bad event to a smaller fraction of the population, but how many companies deliver the mythical 5 nines uptime?https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/feature/The-Holy-Grail-of-five-nines-reliability
- Twitter's first years involved a lot of fail whale moments, enough so that it became part of the expected user experience. "some of our users feel very connected to it" https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/
- Does an acknowledgement help repair the harm done? 
- What if a firm explicitly promise to do better, or perhaps tell the customer specifically how they intend to "learn from" the mistake?
- Should the firm spiff the customer something valuable to offset the letdown? 
- As a matter of empirical record, there's enough data on these trials to support a very specific apology strategy. In a nutshell, the strategy that multiple experiments recommend is: Don't bother.
- Let's unpack this, since it runs counter to what's best for maintaining good interpersonal relationships. The first and most important thing to recognize is that interactions with a brand differ in important dimensions from person-to-person contact.
    - In human relationships, one's reputational value inherently has skin in the game. 
        - Even for one-time interactions (such as tipping at an airport you'll never visit again), our self-image can be undermined if we see ourselves as too selfish to care about social norms toward others.
        - [ ] Loewenstein's lab on this 
    - The invisible hand that brought the customer and company together hinges on self-interest. 
    - The motivation of potential profit drives a company to deliver value, yet it's implausible that such a connection should be mistaken for friendship.
    - Interactions with a company create expectations that aren't attached to a single recognizable face or individual. Even when a CEO is a rock star (e.g., Steve Jobs or Elon Musk), customers interact with their products rather than with that leader.
    - The transactional nature of business is not nakedly broadcast. At some points, the experience will reveal that the business exchange involves efficiency rather than intimacy. qv Tyler Cowen
    - Economists call apologies offered without further backing 'cheap talk."
        - Both parties may realize that 'cheap talk' is an option, some companies try to back up their commitment with something of tangible value. 
        - "On time or free" may push pizza-deliveries, but even Domino's seems to no longer commit to that.
        - The cheapest apologies seem to waft from serial privacy abuser Mark Zuckerberg https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/19/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-privacy-apologies.html 
            - Facebook's corporate apologies mirror Weinstein's interpersonal shenanigans. Trotted out so frequently, the company's reckless behavior leans into them as a drunkard might insist on only driving cars with airbags. 
            - Harrods, the premier luxury retailer in London, once had a full-time employee whose sole responsibility was to be sacked to appease particularly irate customers. https://henrytapper.com/2010/01/09/an-employee-whose-job-was-to-be-sacked/ 
    - Different Uber teams tried to roll out refunds, hoping to repair a defect with an apology. (John List 2017)

    - To back up the “cheap talk,” Uber teams gave $5 refunds for late rides. Net return on apology treatment was negative. The main impact of a refund appears to be heightened memorability of the bad experience.
    - "Breaking into Jail" is jargon for calling explicit attention to a mistake you've made
        - Disclosures are required in SEC prospectuses, but only the most acute analysts seem to attend to the risks they mention.
        - Being pre-emptive, rather than following a specific experience, they're no match for the confirmation bias of excited investors. 
            - Public admissions of being paid by an interested party have negligible impact on evaluation of a journal article (Ariely)
    - Explicit apologies by medical professionals were thought to reduce malpractice suits, so much that insurance industry successfully lobbied to change the law. A medical professional's apology could not be used as evidence in court, and the hope was that doctor's would then be free to admit to making mistakes without costly litigation. 
        - Extensive empirical data showed that medical apologies only serve to direct attention toward error. "An apology may alert the patient to malpractice she would not otherwise have discovered." (“Sorry” Is Never Enough, 2019, Stanford Law Review) https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/print/article/sorry-is-never-enough/
    - There is very little evidence that apologies result in a repaired relationship.
    - Intuitions (based on interpersonal experience) are so strong that many Uber teams simply assume that “all the previous apologies were not correctly phrased/delivered/explained”
        - Repeated experiments (internal & external to Uber) demonstrate there may be no magic wording that significantly outperforms silence
