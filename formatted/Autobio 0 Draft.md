- It's pretty clear that I've been an intellectual fame-ball throughout my career, so I can cop to this at the outset. Since the dawn of the commercial internet (synch'd with Mozilla's launch in 1994), I've been a bystander to the SiliValley Renaissance. Prior to moving to California, perhaps after breaking a mirror in the midWest, I spent 7 years in and around Cambridge.
- Living near Harvard & MIT gave me an opportunity to wander into talks to gawk at people I'd only read about in books. For the first 5 of those years,  my workdays were spent in rather marginal jobs, waiting tables, clocking in at a factory, or setting digital printouts. 
- I designed my work life to maximize the freedom to pursue my own curiosity. One of the more surprising aspects of the academy is that gate-keepers only guard the access to credentials. Unless a class is a small interactive seminar, nearly every professor is more than happy to share the non-rivalrous good of their insights. As I wended my way, I audited classes at Harvard, MIT, BU, and Tufts. I also pored over the Harvard Gazette and diligently read the cork bulletin boards for visitors coming through to give talks. 
- In my last 2 years, I ended up getting a Master's at the Harvard Ed School, before going on to complete the 23rd grade at Stanford, where I received a PhD in experimental psychology.
- When I moved to Boston (more precisely, Somerville, the working-class town abutting Cambridge), I'm sure it was in pursuit of the feeling of feeling smart. Belatedly, it's clear what a handicap that posed to developing my own native talent. The ease of snooping on the output of luminaries, who've won every prize in their field, undercuts the crucial process of starting with inchoate thoughts. It was a mistake to be impressed by their achievement, to only view their ideas when fully-baked, and to have believed that engagement with ideas was a job for fans and spectators. 
- I can't fault the intellectual taste of my own curiosity. Many thinkers who excited me as an undergrad (most significantly, Kahneman & Tversky, when I came across their new book on Heuristics & Biases) continued to hold my interest even as I got to suit up. Even at the height of academic participation, during grad school at Stanford, readers will see me as more of backup player who cheered from the bench. 
- My particular anxieties didn't superficially appear as the classic Impostor Syndrome. My conscious self-presentation adopted the Scarecrow's posture, after he's received his sheepskin by the Wizard of Oz. Herb Simon, one of the remarkable minds I met, wrote that an intellectual was somebody who thought that their professors were normal people. My hyper-verbal intellect deflected my insecurity using the words of one of Don DeLillo's characters:  my subliminal thought was that nobody was any better than me. 
- Only recently have I realized that my particular form of the Impostor Syndrome arrived in the quietest hours, during the dark of night, as I struggled to put my big ideas on paper. Paralyzed by knowing so much, having read almost everything that wasn't on the syllabus, made me unable to see what possible contribution needed to be added. My most recurrent self-insult was to label myself a "high IQ moron."
- I'm afraid that even this post, dwelling on the Remarkable Minds I've Met and Pestered, sustains the illusion that dropping all these names will somehow earn me some distinction. Certainly I collected all these encounters motivated in part by the ambition that their particular genius might infect me. Why record all these anecdotes of sighting
