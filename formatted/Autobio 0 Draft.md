- It's pretty clear that I've been an intellectual fame-ball throughout my career, so I can cop to this at the outset. Since the dawn of the commercial internet (synch'd with Mozilla's launch in 1994), I've been a bystander to the SiliValley Renaissance. Prior to moving to California, perhaps after breaking a mirror in the midWest, I spent 7 years in and around Cambridge.
- Living near Harvard & MIT gave me an opportunity to wander into talks to gawk at the people you read about in books. My workdays were always spent in rather marginal jobs, waiting tables, clocking in at a factory, or printing camera-ready digital print outs. 
- I designed my work life to maximize the freedom to pursue my own curiosity. One surprising fact of the academy is that gate-keepers only care about guarding access to credentials. If you're benighted enough to think that learning is the real reward, nearly every professor is willing to share the non-rivalrous good of auditing their insights. I audited classes at Harvard, MIT, BU, and Tufts. I also pored over the weekly Harvard Gazette and diligently scanned cork bulletin boards for visitors coming through to give talks. 
- When I moved to Boston (more precisely, Somerville, the working-class town abutting Cambridge), it was in pursuit of the feeling of feeling smart. Belatedly, it's clear what a handicap that posed to developing my own native talent. The ease of snooping on the output of luminaries, who've won every prize in their field, undercuts the crucial process of starting with inchoate thoughts. It was a mistake to be impressed by their achievement, to only view their ideas when fully-baked, and to have believed that engagement with ideas was a job for fans and spectators. 
- Moving between different campuses in Boston spotlighted how each school groomed their students for a distinct role in society. Harvard's classrooms could resemble little board rooms. MIT's Thistle, their alternative newspaper, once greeted the new freshman with the headline "Welcome to Hell".
- In my last 2 years, I ended up paying for a Master's at the Harvard Ed School, before going on to complete the 23rd grade at Stanford (for a PhD in experimental psychology).
- Even keeping in mind Descartes' joke that every person believes they possess an abundance of good sense https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/515934-good-sense-is-of-all-things-among-men-the-most, I can't fault the intellectual taste of my own curiosity. 
- Many thinkers who excited me as an undergrad (most significantly, Kahneman & Tversky, who rocked my world when Heuristics & Biases was first published in '83) continued to hold my interest even after I got a chance to suit up. Even at the height of academic participation, during grad school at Stanford, readers will see me that I was a backup player in the big leagues, who mostly cheered from the bench. 
- My particular anxiety didn't superficially manifest as the classic Impostor Syndrome. My conscious self-presentation adopted the Scarecrow's bluster, upon receiving a sheepskin from the Wizard of Oz. 
- Herb Simon, one of the remarkable minds I met, wrote in his autobiography that an intellectual was somebody who thought that their professors were normal people. My hyper-verbal intellect deflected my insecurity using the words of one of Don DeLillo's characters:  my subliminal thought was that nobody was any better than me. 
- Only recently have I realized that my particular form of the Impostor Syndrome arrived in the quietest hours, during the dark of night, as I struggled to put my big ideas on paper. Paralyzed by knowing so much, having read almost everything that wasn't on the syllabus, made me unable to see what possible contribution needed to be added. My most recurrent self-insult was to label myself a "high IQ moron."
- I'm afraid that even this post, dwelling on the Remarkable Minds I've Met and Pestered, sustains the illusion that dropping all these names will somehow earn me some distinction. Certainly I collected all these encounters motivated in part by the ambition that others' particular genius might infect me. Why record all these anecdotes of big-brained sightings? 
- Fellini coined the term paparazzo to suggest "a buzzing insect, hovering, darting, stinging." On many campuses, at least the ones I've frequented, a marginally sane person shows up so frequently at talks that they're as recognizable as Jimmy Kimmel's "Guillermo." Until I matriculated in '92, I was __that__ guy. (At Stanford in the '90s, the most prominent was Joe Euclid https://www.quora.com/Who-was-Joe-Euclid-and-where-is-he-now)
