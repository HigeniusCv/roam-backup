- [journal](<journal.md>) Today feels a tad like a Groundhog do-over day, since everything above lists the to-dos I hand wrote on Monday. Once that was done, all I accomplished was to belatedly (-5 mins) join Sara & Neil's shiva for her father. Mir also joined eventually, assuring me then that we'd actually been invited to this particular session. But do-overs count, and are infinitely preferable to do-nevers
