- We research, strategize, & design for behavioral impact:
    - Co-design workshops and product sprints (for [example](https://paul-sas.squarespace.com/workshops))
    - Qualitative research to surface best customer-centered bets ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQmecSISO9vznC6_-WuTRrVwX6LFqXCkGAsbRwNVpavi3OHAVHruOuTy9cHSqqR_g_0kRvNpEyWkuwV/pub?delayms=3000&loop=false&start=false))
    - Mixed-method approaches (in-lab studies, interviews, field ethnographies, wizard of oz simulations)  ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQmecSISO9vznC6_-WuTRrVwX6LFqXCkGAsbRwNVpavi3OHAVHruOuTy9cHSqqR_g_0kRvNpEyWkuwV/pub?delayms=3000&loop=false&start=false))
    - Statistically rigorous quantitative surveys. Deploy[ metrics for experience, emotional engagement, flow](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brief-index-flow-motivation-paul-sas/) ([example](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brief-index-flow-motivation-paul-sas/))
    - Rapidly iterate on research insights cashed out in behavioral impacts ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQmecSISO9vznC6_-WuTRrVwX6LFqXCkGAsbRwNVpavi3OHAVHruOuTy9cHSqqR_g_0kRvNpEyWkuwV/pub?delayms=3000&loop=false&start=false))

- We work with companies to strategize, design, & run research for behavioral impact:
    - Co-design workshops and sprints to translate behavioral principles into productized prototypes
    - Qualitative research, adapted to dovetail time & resource constraints. Explore and surface most promising customer-centered bets ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQmecSISO9vznC6_-WuTRrVwX6LFqXCkGAsbRwNVpavi3OHAVHruOuTy9cHSqqR_g_0kRvNpEyWkuwV/pub?delayms=3000&loop=false&start=false))
    - Prototype design iterations to evaluate optimal path for execution, through a portfolio of mixed method approaches (contextual interviews, ethnographic field observation, wizard of oz simulations, intercepts and in-lab studies)  ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQmecSISO9vznC6_-WuTRrVwX6LFqXCkGAsbRwNVpavi3OHAVHruOuTy9cHSqqR_g_0kRvNpEyWkuwV/pub?delayms=3000&loop=false&start=false))
    - Statistically calibrate qualitative insights in quantitative surveys. We have developed [unique metrics for experience, emotional engagement, flow](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brief-index-flow-motivation-paul-sas/), as well as brand emotion associations, and max diff evaluations. Analyze results with linear and logistic regressions, random forest & relative estimate of importance algorithms from machine learning ([example](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brief-index-flow-motivation-paul-sas/))
    - Iterate rapidly to deliver research insights cashed out as measurable behavioral impacts ([example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQmecSISO9vznC6_-WuTRrVwX6LFqXCkGAsbRwNVpavi3OHAVHruOuTy9cHSqqR_g_0kRvNpEyWkuwV/pub?delayms=3000&loop=false&start=false))
