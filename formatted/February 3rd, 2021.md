- The heart of this course's message: Just Do It.
- We all hope to be validated, and it's particularly meaningful when backed up by marketplace cash.
- Jack Butcher's translates his vision into words here. 
- Learn from what he himself has done so well: 
- What do you wish the world would *let* you do. Do that now, without delay. In a crisp way, get others to benefit from your value.  If you're knocking on the door, waiting to get into *the room where it happens*, don't wait. 
- Without anyone's permission, start the work. Keep honing your most personally valuable work. Share it with the people who won't *let you* in.
- It feels like a criticism to give this only 4 stars. Here's what would've boosted it to 5: The course exemplifies its Just Do It message, with many relevant examples. The element to complement this would involve more explicit coaching, especially for those who find themselves stumbling at the start. The bonus element, a Daily Manifest for structuring your time, is a step toward this (so, 4.5 stars if I could). Perhaps that coaching would require a separate course to build out the guidance for executing on this correct path. 
    - Take the Permissionless path here myself to get my certification
    - Two strands bump against Starting, and I can blog about that
    - Target: submit to Nir upon polish, and share with Jack Butcher
- [Principle of Least Action]
- Start starting, and never stop never stopping
    - Nir's exhortation to TBox is absolutely compelling
        - And yet, what stands between our getting into boxing?
        - If you know but don't go, begin with compassion - OK, I'm already stretching
    - "Ya" is the 0th step - your loyalty card is punched when you receive it
    - Prove it to yourself, tiny step by tiny step - Reward your achieving self 1st 
        - That aspirational aspect is peeping into view
        - Greet it with appreciative curiosity
        - Dwell on the win, not on the obstacle
    - Establish recognition as the way into cognition.
    - The law of attraction resembles the path of a river
        - There is no aversive feedback that's not capable of repulsing forward action
        - If you're curious about what's blocking you, don't look for the reason
        - I just gave you the reason: Your mind will flow toward attraction. Even the slightest uphill gradient will redirect your movement.
        - Psycho-analyzing, ratiocination, rooting for the antecedent causes is just a blocking behavior. Sure, it feels better than moving along the path you're posing as attractive. 
        - The "principle of least action PLA" is one of the deepest levels of explanatory analysis. Beautifully, it's happening at so many different scales. There's surely a welter of contextual facts that shape the path of an electron through a field, a wave of light moving through water or air, a phone falling to the ground, or the movement of a crowd through a stadium gate.
            - principle of least action PLA
        - How would you benefit from knowing the precise placement of every atom along the Mississippi delta over the past century? Are you, perchance, wondering whether there's any evidence disconfirming the Principle of Least Action? Could I persuade you to slake your curiosity by compressing all that mess into the image attached?

    - Let's get back to your box now. *Start here*
        - Grab a post-it, or a blank piece of paper for this initial exercise
        - Write down the time at this moment
        - Add the clock time at T-zero minus 5 (so, if it's 11:30 right now, put a line above it that's listed as 11:25 - 11:30)
        - For that initial time box, write down a label, like "Begin time-boxing"
        - Now, check it off!

- # What do I want to accomplish today?
    - Your most urgent item: Practice Focus
    - Your most important item: Jobbing
    - One more thing you want to get done: RE-turn to R studio
    - ~~Something you already got done today...~~ Draw gestures
- To start making MY philosophy of focus explicit:
    - **Try to visualize what a focused __working__ life means for ME.**
    - __Which activities will make a difference five years from now? __Reading widely continues, but I bring a higher level of systematic search & research: Regularly consulting academic journals; intentional about what I need from the pubs; Habitual note taking that feeds into sharing pith of the findings, daily on twitter and at least weekly in a blog
    - Writing will be as serious and regular a practice as meditating and exercising is today. Difficulties and strains in tackling problems will be approached with curiosity and compassion.
    - I will cultivate a zeal for the hardest path, and will celebrate every obstacle with a stoic's delight in growing stronger.
    - __Which activities will I begin to omit?__
    - Desultory and anxious tracking of news & social media
    - FOMO about being on top of the current fads of the zeitgeist
    - **Next, visualize what a focused life in my __personal__ time will be**.
    - __What will I spend my free time doing? __
    - Tangling with unknown - As I zero my attention in on more deeply understanding important questions around motivation and behavior change, the shift in focus will be evident as I catalogue what's still uncertain.
    - People around me will have some sense of what's my problem. Those who are interested will share their own ideas, adding to the chances I'll have to reflect on and reconsider my own thoughts on my central question(s).
    - What distractions would you cut down on?
    - Reading everything that's vaguely relevant. If I haven't identified how the reading meets an open question of my own curiosity, that book or article should be deferred.
    - Trying to be interesting to people who don't share my interests.
    - **Hit REPLY and tell me your vision of the focused life.**
- PS - I enjoyed your deep dive on motivation, and absolutely count myself as a William James disciple https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2020/11/02/motivation/
