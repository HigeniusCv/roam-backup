- The heart of this course's message: Just Do It.
- We all hope to be validated, and it's particularly meaningful when backed up by marketplace cash.
- Jack Butcher's translates his vision into words here. 
- Learn from what he himself has done so well: 
- What do you wish the world would *let* you do. Do that now, without delay. In a crisp way, get others to benefit from your value.  If you're knocking on the door, waiting to get into *the room where it happens*, don't wait. 
- Without anyone's permission, start the work. Keep honing your most personally valuable work. Share it with the people who won't *let you* in.
- It feels like a criticism to give this only 4 stars. Here's what would've boosted it to 5: The course exemplifies its Just Do It message, with many relevant examples. The element to complement this would involve more explicit coaching, especially for those who find themselves stumbling at the start. The bonus element, a Daily Manifest for structuring your time, is a step toward this (so, 4.5 stars if I could). Perhaps that coaching would require a separate course to build out the guidance for executing on this correct path. 
    - Take the Permissionless path here myself to get my certification
    - Two strands bump against Starting, and I can blog about that
    - Target: submit to Nir upon polish, and share with Jack Butcher
- Start starting, and never stop never stopping
    - Nir's exhortation to TBox is absolutely compelling
        - And yet, what stands between our getting into boxing?
        - If you know but don't go, begin with compassion - OK, I'm already stretching
    - "Ya" is the 0th step - your loyalty card is punched when you receive it
    - Prove it to yourself, tiny step by tiny step - Reward your achieving self 1st 
        - That's the aspect that is peeping into view, and greet it with appreciative curiosity
        - Dwell on the win, not on the obstacle
    - Establish recognition as the way into cognition.
    - The law of attraction resembles the path of a river
        - There is no aversive feedback that's not capable of repulsing forward action
        - If you're curious about what's blocking you, don't look for the reason
        - I just gave you the reason: Your mind will flow toward attraction. Even the slightest uphill gradient will redirect your movement.
        - Psycho-analyzing, ratiocination, rooting for the antecedent causes is just a blocking behavior. Sure, it feels better than moving along the path you're posing as attractive. 
        - The "principle of least action" is one of the deepest levels of explanatory analysis. Beautifully, it's happening at so many different scales. There's surely a welter of contextual facts that shape the path of an electron through a field, a wave of light moving through water or air, a phone falling to the ground, or the movement of a crowd through a stadium gate.
            - principle of least action
        - How would you benefit from knowing the precise placement of every atom along the Mississippi delta over the past century? Are you, perchance, wondering whether there's any evidence disconfirming the Principle of Least Action? Could I persuade you to slake your curiosity by compressing all that mess into the image attached? (Or, if it's more familiar, little Jeffy's Family Circus path home)
