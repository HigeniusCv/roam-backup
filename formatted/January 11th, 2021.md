- ## HMW improve mask comfort, sociability AND Safety?
    - __Mgurfle mnenting beez eyen... Sorry, let me take off my mask to describe this  workshop__
    - Human Centered Design will be crucial for our "New Norms" of PPE (personal protective equipment)
    - Behavioral scientist Paul Sas founded Higeni.us to assess and design protection for daily comfort and sociability. Masks today are merely good-enough for outdoor exposure, with perhaps a nod to fashionable accessorizing.
    - This workshop will provide design researchers with an introductory assessment of the landscape of current options in terms of the__** CARES experience methodology**__
- ###   __Comfort__
- ###   __Audibility__ of speech
- ###   __Risk__ calibration
- ###   __Ease__ of using correctly for sustained time
- ###   __Sociable__ - going from smize to full facial expression
- ## In this introductory workshop, you receive
    - **1-page tool to qualitatively assess 5 CARES dimensions** in the field
    - **Invite to publish your field observations **for inclusion & recognition in forthcoming white paper
    - Info on **future HCD workshops to prototype next-generation PPE**

- Meeting ID: 846 1899 5223  Passcode: 02139
- ## This workshop will provide Designers & UXResearchers with the information and tools to start improving masks
    - A human-centered design focus will make masks more comfortable, sociable AND safer than current options. __If you have  worn facial protection anytime in the past year, you are qualified to participate__.
    - We will survey the landscape of current facial protection (both consumer and medical options).  We will then assess  PPE in terms of the CARES experience methodology:
- ### Comfort
- ### Audibility of speech
- ### Risk calibration
- ### Ease of using correctly for sustained time
- ### Sociable - going from smize to full facial expression will receive
- ## Attendees will get
    - **1-page tool to qualitatively assess 5 CARES dimensions in the field**
    - **Invite to include your own field observations for inclusion & recognition in forthcoming published white paper**
    - **Opportunity to contribute to HCD workshops prototyping next-generation PPE**
