- Wormald et al., using 5 mL Tc99m-labeled irrigation solution, found better nasal cavity and sinus distribution with douche administration than nebulization or sprays [Fend](<Fend.md>) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879729615001003
- __in vitro__ at least, it would seem that limited sodium chloride content is important for nasal irrigation solutions. Conversely, calcium provides an advantage in terms of restoring epithelial trophicity and mucociliary efficacy.
- Ringer's lactate, which is rich in calcium and potassium and less rich in sodium and chloride ions than isotonic saline, provided a stronger increase in [mucociliary transport](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mucociliary-transport) than isotonic saline
