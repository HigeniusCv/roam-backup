- Have been using paper this week, in order to time block the day. Still don't have enough lookahead to do an entire week. Also, even though it's bumped up significantly my work on my portfolio, finally annotated version of Sept work at Uber was updated to my blog yesterday. I need to do a bunch more of those. Varo could be expanded a lot. FEND and or MiracleGrow also can get a mention. Brand Research Questions and Flow also worthy of sharing.
- Exercise has been adequate. Almost everyday I've closed my rings, biking to Cordonices or Indian Rock or just to the top of Cedar. It still daunts me to go striaght uphill so it's not as if I'm so strong I don't feel the burn instantly on inclines. Goal is to ascend Marin before the years end.
- Lynette Rationalist meetings have earned their expense ($150).
- Blocks that are still worth working on:
- Intermittent Fasting slid a lot since I bought Shapa, actaully a twee bit before, but deinitely perseisntly since I've been 210 rather than200. 
- Sleep appears to not be as high quality
- Lot more angst as I close out an entire year without significant income. When does IRS tell me it's just a hobby rataher than a businsss?
- It's been a month since Ricardo came up. He's not my child, although I've practiced on him my entire life. 
- Absolutely persuaded that the podcast Freakonomics on the Somerville study pertains to his interaction with me. I've not helped him, esp'ly in comparison to his brother who's the semi-control.

He may well end up on the streets, rather than someone else's couch. STOP
- Convergence on Deep Work is primarily pushed by abstinence from news, twitter, and such. I pretty much know I can't touch it during the daylight hours.
- Being THC free is also its own boost in clarity and calm.
- Anger Man last night really bored me. I find the repression of one of the Asian engineers, and the blind spot of the research biologist, and the deflective blaming of the lawyer, all too repetitive to continue learning from. Jonathan is practically a real friend, so it's not necessary to depend on the Aman. I thought about how it'd be nice if I dialed down to twice a moht, rather than quit altogether. I should stealthily probe that, starting with one miss in December, since we're only meeting 3x in Nov and Dec. In less than 60 days, I'll be 58, and need to go on another silencio.
- Firdays, for the last 2 weeks, have involved big nature trips with Hawaiian booster. (3.5 Muir, 4.5 in Tilden). It's opening some windows, even if I've not found the door to walk through.
- Last Fri I realized pretty clearly some important directions to advance my work, even before I ate the caps. So, I
