- Fri the 29th I took a trip to Muir Woods, arriving at 9:30am, and after parking in the closest overflow, I went away and turned right at the first fire road. Eventually, I joined Dipsea trail, and got close to the top of Cardiac Hill, before being buzzed away by a noisy family that swarmed the trail toward the summit. Lone Tree was apparently Dipsea's original name
