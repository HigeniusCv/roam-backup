- Today I'm going to time block, after listening to the blissed out Nir Eyal's pitch on starting with You, adding Relationships, then Work
- My work today: already pinged Saebra about Salesforce. Send Penny Fend-y a note (will be 3rd w/o a reply)
- Yesterday's meeting with YakC's connected hyperlink went well, and given that they pace the course development over 6 weeks, that's not a huge dent in my current commitments
- Talked with Neil late last night. He's motoring on with the Hospital data, even though it's not constrained by a specific problem. Maybe he should just focus on one medical specialty (like surgery or x-rays) as an MVP? [texted that to him just now]
- Salesforce pitch: CBT/DBT bake in. 
- My mac keyboard is quite clunky. I almost dropped it off to get repaired, but I am not set up to go 5 days without
- Musical beds was mentioned by me at RCA last night. This am, during our kitchen flash Swedish check in, my ask of HP was to help us discuss this without animus.
- Can I set ROAM to accept "w/o" w/o deflecting to a command?
- The Self stuff today: Shopping at Safeway for milk would hijack, so just drop an extra dime and get it at the corner. 
- [ ] Time box from 9:30 to 9;30pm
