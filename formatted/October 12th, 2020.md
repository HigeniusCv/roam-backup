- Woke at 8 - Yesterday was a lapse-letter day. 
- The morning began with an alternate activity from shul, to substitute for the simcha torah dance that would occur in a shul. Called walk-afot, houses hosted specific parashot, left stickers with a poster posing one question from the parasha. 1511 chose Yitro (I can only indistinctly recall my BarM Vayera? Nope, it's Vayigash)
- We bumpt into a lot of our congregants - David Radwin, Betsy & Tracy, Sarah Lefton, Claire Sherman, Ed Silberman, Marcia Brooks, the Massarano's from a distance, et al) Also, when I hit the shul solo for Shemot, saw both the shul-niks, Rabbi Chai & Renna, the rabbi with her 5 year old son, Renna with partner Elana & little guy; also saw the Gerweins after Mir went off, and to quote my approach to life now, "I avoid comparing these days to anything but itself. There's still plenty of things to be grateful for, even in a war." The Fendel home we visited together, and Tamar said Ari goes out to play basketball, but Amir almost never leaves the house. Ari & Yossi took a trip to Denver for the next batch of weeks; wonder what Yossi does that requires a trip these days.
- In the risk calculus, there's a softening going on, and the sacrificers are reluctant to believe that the past isolation may have been an over-reaction. The death rate is lower than originally; schools don't seem to be super-spreaders; air travel is also much safer than thought (although it'd be helpful to have some sort of breakdown by route)
- On Mir's Silverman sunday call, Edna, Steffen & Dolly, + us & Jira. I joined for 15 mins, and sort of man-grabbed the mic, not to talk much myself, but to MC the introjection of pointed questions.
    - Steffen nurses students in the Yale Jail, and they've usu only had one or two at any time in the dorm. Also, none have had really dangerous symptoms, which again suggests that the new normal doesn't require bunkering down.
- Once I was over near Rosa Parks, the devil on my shoulder kept arguing that after a month of smobriety, I could THC on a Sunday. My rationalization extended to some quasi resentment that Josiah, our co-sponsors in RCA, perseverates on the joy and wisdom of Marijuana Anonymous. 
- The $5 house Sativa went with a purchased lighter at the Ashby Walgreens. Whence I puffed the magic dragon behind Discount Fabrics, before double masking up to explore.
    - How did i find myself biking to Bad Houses, the place I knew I mustn't go? Places no respectable man would be seen
        - I tell myself I will not go, even as I drive myself there?
