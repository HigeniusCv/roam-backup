- Spoke to Ricardo last night, and it feels good to be able to pour all my codependency energy into my little brother. Being a guardian / parent to him is not truly codependent. I first let Mir know that I was concerned for him, since i got back in touch with me the 1st of Oct, she wanted us to save him
    - At first, his mental health just didn't seem at all good. His little brother had reached out to me via Facebook to exhort him to get help. Actually, Daniel wanted me to talk to his mom, Maria Elena, but that would absolutely enmesh me, esp now that my spanish is so weak.
    - Warning signs directly: His anxiety about embolisms from covid was a little atypical; the anger at his family's selfish and wasteful choices rang with impotent rage; his suspicion about doing therapy over the internet, since he didn't want anyone keeping that info; his sleeping hours are vampiric; his car was repossessed; his gardening and baking were full prepper 
- Even though I'm not as reflexively trying to save him as Mir wanted (let's give him the FWM!), I do hope I can give him support to aright himself.
- He's open to doing Lambda school, to become a data scientist, which is awesome, and builds on his 2 years of college calculus. In order to help him move forward with that, since he doesn't have programming, we're going to try to buddy up and do Statistics with R together, starting today at 11;30am
- I would be willing to sell him the FWM, with a $200/month loan. I don't want to bring this up so soon, but I could once he can start to get a leg up on his finances.
- Absolute brain wave talking with him last night was that he could be the savior of the Shield. Marketing has been an insuperable hurdle, and it now seems clear that they'll only sell themselves at a place like an airport or outside a Safeway, etc. But since that's going to involve exposure, it was still born as a venture for kids. 
    - I've been telling Ricardo that his covid risks are lower than his mental health peril, so that he shouldn't bar himself from participating in essential worker shit jobs. He'd been angry at his sister for taking a job at Target, but why not? 
    - His mom's boyfriend has apparently offered him work at his restaurant, but I seriously advised him to not get caught up in depending on his mom for income.
    - I'm TAP-ping into my manic scheme, now that there's a guy who can act on it. Living in Santa Clara, he's not far from the SJ airport, and within 4 miles of the airport is a Tap plastic store. 
    - I figure he can sell them by just wearing one at the airport, with a signal that says he has spare shields in case someone wants them. I guess he could experiment with his spiel, up to even telling cops that he gives them away as a public health benefit. 
        - Getting into Sales is a very Actor-ly role to practice. 
        - Besides hawking them at airports, he could go around to restaurants and places with essential staff, small biz's.
        - The artisanal crappiness of the shields may eventually need to be upgraded, but first, he should make his first $100 selling them.
    - I'm getting enough out of my own coach, Lynette, that I could consider finding and hiring a coach for Ricardo. It is a gift that keeps giving. 
        - Truthfully, when I hired Neil Fiore back when the kids were tiny, I couldn't activate enough focus to follow through
        - Ricardo right now is in a high, having moved out of his mom's place, now staying with his cousin Benji (on his Dad's side)
    - Guard against expropriating his body as an external muscle for my piped schemes. I do hope I can be loving without being co-dependent / enmeshed
    - Today, I'm giving a job talk at Instacart with a woman who is quite a bit younger than me. I almost wrote 'junior', but obviously, I'm junior to so many in ways that would enable them to help me manage myself.
    - One of the most surprising things about the Uber memories is how many of those UXRs now feel to be important colleagues I can lean on. Ya Gao, Yiang Liu, Saebra, Krystle, Daniel Camilleri, JLo of course, but others who are stretch connections, like Audrey St Aubin, Jeannette Mellinger, Andy Warr
        - Imagine if I had built as many good connections at Intuit.
            - [February 25th, 2020](<February 25th, 2020.md>) Letter to KathySchlamp [never answered, which is all for the best]
            - I'm interested in the Principal UXR position at Wells, and it's good news that I already know the hiring manager. :)
            -  After 5 years of running my own consulting, I hope I've learned some of the skills that you were trying to coach me in. When I look back at the time I was working for you in DIG, I'm proud of the great work that I was involved in, from the initial project on Payments with Leah, the First Time Use studies that built on DIG's principles of D4D, and the evangelizing of Behavioral Econ.
            -  It was my HOW that belatedly strikes me as an obstacle to your willingness to consider managing me again. It's more than slightly embarrassing to be such a slow learner about social things that a person like you knows so well.
            -  Over the past 5 years, my biggest growth areas have been in terms of managing my own ego: becoming aware of how much better the work can be when it's planned in coordination with partners, paced in a tempo that enables more practice and less improvisation, and communicated in a voice that spotlights the team as a whole. About a year ago, I came across past performance evaluations from you, and it was hard for me to accept how selfishly I'd acted. At this stage in my career, I've come to realize that I don't have to ask other people to put up with that, and when I manage myself better, the work itself is a lot more rewarding.
            - If you could let me know whether you'd consider me for the SF position, I would happily follow up with a more formal application.
        - Quit with the if-only's. Being such a silverback, and only now understanding the futility and isolation that was self-inflicted through self-absorbed anxiety, it's fortunately not unbearable. Such a freaking slow-learner!
- Doing Statistics with R - I shoulda started sooner, if I coulda only built a time-machine first. 
- Just counted the words here, and it's above 1K, which seems a good time to switch to doing my jobs.
