- Yesterday, interviewed with Instacart (prakriti) at 2pm. It wasn't very smooth, and I learned not to compress the study into a single set of snapshots, when she would have been happier to just watch the entire movie. The impulse to compress, condense, gnarl into a minimum packet, is a strength of mine, but it oft leaves people feeling they can't follow the thread.
- Before the meeting had ended, I was already starting to feel down. Upon the wrap, it was a good thing that the worst impulse I could gratify was to go eat something
    - Read a lot of the book about Jean Nidetsch, by an author who larded up the book with a lot of personal body dysmorphia confessions. Initially, the detailed look into someone else trying to write aloud made me root for her. About the time Weight Watchers was actually launched, I'd wearied of the search for deep insight into why she stuffed her face, and Jean stopped.
    - I am myself stuffing my face a lot these days. Ate a pint of ice cream before dinner, when I went to the Monterey market to pick up items for our falafel & couscous Weds meal. 
    - Some of the trouble goes back to falling into my head with Dan Ariely's scale, Shapa, the app that only lets you know directionally what is up with your weight. I paid $95 to subscribe, and then, following the patterned behaviors for a fortnight, I progressively gained weight 
    - Another dollop of fat comes from the replacement of THC. Mir always assumed that munchies must follow from pot, but I didn't always find that to be true.
    - What I still find appalling, in retrospect, is the near black out quality of evenings where I'd get quite high. Keep on keeping smober!
- Ricardo is coming up this afternoon, and I'm tempted to sell him my van. I need to button up the legal issues there, since it's still unclear what was the demon that haunted him years ago when we asked him to take care of our kids, and they reported his lifting his hands off the steering wheel while covering his eyes. I've never asked him about this, but since he'll be in our backyard this afternoon, I should consider probing this.
- In my 3rd week of todo'ing, I am learning more about the oscillation between to-done and to-didn't. 
- Especially given the dreary experience of the insta-interview, I must amp up the consulting line. Neil told me about his buddy David Rose getting $500k from Miracle Gro to do AI landscaping. 
    - Made me click into the opportunities to shazam-le the movablenesting by somehow coupling digital signal processing to the sound muffling.
- That's my 15 - break!
