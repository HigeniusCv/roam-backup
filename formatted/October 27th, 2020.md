- The political malaise is nearly impossible to insulate myself from. The history books can cover this lurching instability toward naked power grabs. My reluctance to watch the Handmaid's Tale is more than ever an ostrich's defense strategy. I'm not going to detail the injustices and insanity here
- Compressed some July & August "Bugles", mostly from Beckett, all the way up to the first day of school 8/17. There's little whiffs of the mood changes in the wider world. Haircuts as clues. Primary sources, I suppose, and perhaps of some interest to the men they will become. 
- I can't speculate here on how long and mad this road will be. Even now, it's apparent that we've not seen the actual reckoning, for shuttering up the population, impairing their educations, foreclosing the economic opportunities, wasting the capital invested in an alternative future we're never likely to see return
- My investment in ROAM continues a building, even though the github script that's designed to back up my notes is on constant fail. I sort of treat that as a  cost of the learning curve.
    - I bought Nate Eliason's notes from 200+ kindle books for $25, and it plotzed me right into Evernote's bowels. Oy
- R studio is rewarding my sustained attention. It's worth the time, and the tutoring fees, and the effort.
- Coursera is a jumble, with some nice motivational kickers, and some turgid interface confusions.
- My left eye is infected, somehow, and I've been amping up acyclovir, until I talk to the ophthamologist at Kaiser tomorrow. It's a fear I've harbored for decades, that my dick will kill my brain. Googling the HSV links showed that the level of alarm for ocular infection is not quite at the level of panic I hold within myself. It can't possibly be a good thing, but the jump from eye to encephalitis is not described as inevitable. The treatment is just acyclovir, and I'd been self-medicating that since last Weds when I felt sore. The websites describe that serious cases may entail continuously taking Acyclovir, so that's the limit.
- Work continues to happen. 
- I am irritable, without showing the irk, so that's a smidge of progress. When I'm listening to an audiobook, doing kitchen work, I don't enjoy being interrupted. My hearing is also not super acute, so even if I stop playing the tape, I may not make out the exact words being shouted across the house. Miryam's voice has always been less audible, and since there's an extra tone of plaintiveness added, my reflex reaction is not kind or openhearted.
    - Leonard Cohen's line recurs, politest guy who hated everyone in the room. Googlewhacking off those terms didn't return the precise quote, but I can search within the Israeli's bio of LC
    - I've a ton of work to get to being grateful and softer hearted toward the little friction points that interrupt my flight from self. 
    - With my sons, the conflict has dropped considerably during Covid. 
    - Beckett is now the sweetest, biggest fan of his Pa, the guy who comes up and chooses me to be his cuddle. 
    - Y has been nicer, more tolerant, of late.
