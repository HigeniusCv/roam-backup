- Starting earlier than 10 is the new norm. Yesterday blagued out in the afternoon, and even manifested itself as a meat meal for lunch around 3pm. 
    - Not working mayn't be so bad, but surfing sucks
    - Even when I stop a-twittering, the emotional hang over is full of angst
- The portfolio update is clearly my ((frog))
    - Obviously still stammering with ROAM
- Sara Wolfensohn and I are going to z-chat, which'll be fun, just as a fresh angle on my social circuit. She must have a hard time picking social outlets, as she has so many dear friends, but apparently stalls on vulnerability in public
- Sent Ricardo a text, a little ambivalent, "want to send you a shot of unconditional love." Not quite the same as feeling fully able to do so. He's been incommunicado orally for almost 2 weeks, and I have to remember that we're not trying to fix my previous life mistakes
- Ophthamologist looked at my eyes today, and it's not worrisome to her, so I'm letting go of that fear. Apparently eyes can get cold sores. Arrgh. The treatment would still be acyclovir, so pumping that hasn't missed a beat. I'll stop after today, which is at least 5 or 7 days.
- The risk of HSV, esp'ly with potential encephalitis, may be horrid, but given the installed population of infected, can't be that common.
- As much as I think I'd like to draw a bit every day, when I carry around Ms Barry's book, I don't crack it. Probably means I should do that immediately after today's journaling.
- Focusmate still helps, although it isn't as cold slapping as first
- Cold showers happen about 1x day. Wim Hof said to start with warm, which dilates the time commitment by 3. There's never a time that it doesn't shock my system. Each time I wish I knew the Breath practice
