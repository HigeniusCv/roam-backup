- Be careful about listening to Taylor Swift - boy does it stick in the ear loop
- Did draw yesterday (Baby photo) & this AM (the body mannequin)
- Do I still believe I should sign up for the $1k Write of Passage? I haven't been publishing weekly, and I guess that if I could hit it 10 times, then I wouldn't have to Stickk myself with the Perell-ous tuition
- Afternoons are slippery than the morning times, which is progress in itself, although also a regress. Shrink it down a bit. In the later afternoon yesterday, I begun putting up portfolio work on ME.com
- Stuck? Not really actually
- Wake up or go down with a fleeting thought of Ricardo. It'll be 2 weeks w/o a word from him beyond a fatuous text in reply to my faking full acceptance. If I am impatient and annoyed with him, empathize with how he must feel toward himself.
- Remember the silent retreat back on Jan 7? I could've had a baby this span. What's been gestating? Lurches toward ack'ing the plague and adjusting.
- I was semi-joking, but not entirely, about learning a trade involving HVAC. Wonder how long it takes? "In as little as 9 months" How much does it pay? Even if it were just $30/hour, it would put me on a track to earn for the next 18 years. I could be like the RHS librarian, Larry Grau, who continuously schemed to find an extra income stream while coaching the chess team. When I wonder where D'Arcy went, I often feel that there's a high likelihodd that he will or has already pulled the trigger on the gun he used to keep beneath his bed. A decrepit house off the 7th trfwy in KC KS (623 Tauromee Ave) actually shows a worn sign on the house's side door that legibly but corruptedly says Law Office. (913) 232-1056 ?
