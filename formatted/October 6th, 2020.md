    - Process of setting and checking off todos was a success. Got work done
    - Especially enjoyed the autobio navel cleaning. I can now save those little niblets for when I hit a wall writing public stuff
    - Spoke to an ex CBO this am, and learned more about how Clover tried apologizing by bring a plant to patients
    - Fell into my browser during this journal, but I don't feel i need to drop a lot in today, since work is capturing my attention
    - One thing about [Delmore](<Delmore.md>) that only now have I realized! Just because [setting goals](<setting goals.md>) is hard, it's not true that I shouldn't set them.  It only took 20 years to connect these 2 dots
