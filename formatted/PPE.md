- “N95 have the worst filtration efficiency for particles around 0.3 If you’re smaller than that those are actually collected even better. It’s counterintuitive because masks do not work like sieving out larger particles. It’s not like pasta in a colander, and small ones don’t get through.”
    - “Brownian motion,” the name given to a physical phenomenon in which particles smaller than 0.3 microns move in an erratic, zig-zagging kind of motion. This motion greatly increases the chance they will be snared by the mask fibers.
    - Secondly, the N95 mask itself uses electrostatic absorption, meaning particles are drawn to the fiber and trapped, instead of just passing through.
    - “Although these particles are smaller than the pores, they can be pulled over by the charged fibers and get stuck
- N95 masks are 95% efficient at stopping particles in their least efficient particle size range — in this case those around 0.3 microns.

        - The mask was then washed at ∼40 ○ C in a conventional washing machine
with detergent. Such treatment would be expected to dissolve the
lipid layer of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The
mask was then air dried, and 
        - its efficiency was measured to be 75% ± 1% [see Fig. 5(b)]. 
        - The mask was then recharged for 60 min using the method of Fig. 3(b), following which its filtration efficiency was measured to be 95%

    - During the air-freshener experiment, the maximum concentration of ultrafine particles was approximately 30,000 particles/cm3. Particle concentrations in the size ranges >1.0, 0.4–0.5 and 0.5–0.6 micrometers were 13, 15 and
11 particles/cm3, respectively. The concentrations of particles in the 0.1 micrometers wide size ranges between 0.3 and 0.4 micrometers and between 0.6 and 1.0 micrometers were <6 particles/ cm3 each.

any one of three widely used respirators, a satisfactory fit could
be achieved by fewer than half of the healthcare workers
tested, and for 28% of the participants none of the masks gave a
satisfactory fit.29 Fit-testing is a laborious task, taking around
30 min to do properly and comprises qualitative fit-testing
(testing whether the respirator-wearing healthcare worker can
taste an intensely bitter or sweet substance sprayed into the
ambient air around the outside of the mask) or quantitative fit
testing (measuring the ratio of particles in the air inside and
outside the breathing zone when wearing the respirator). Attempts have been made to circumvent the requirement for fit
testing, and it has been suggested that self-testing for a seal by
the respirator wearer (see http://youtu.be/pGXiUyAoEd8a for a
video demonstration) is a sufficient substitute for fit-testing.
However, self-checking for a seal has been demonstrated to be
a highly unreliable technique in two separate studies so that full
fit-testing remains a necessary preliminary requirement before
respirators can be used in the healthcare setting

    - **Rainbow Passage
**
        - When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. There is, according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. People look, but no one ever finds it. When a man looks for something beyond reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
    - (6) Grimace by smiling or frowning (only 4 QNFT)
    - (7) Bend over. Bend at waist to touch toes. Jog in place substituted if units do not permit bending at waist.
    - (8) Normal breathing again
- **Qualitative Fit Test (QLFT) Protocols **
    - Isoamyl Acetate IAA Protocol threshold test - banana oil **NOT for Virus**
        - Fit test chamber: 55-gallon drum liner suspended so top of chamber 6 inches above head
        - Hang absorbent paper towel with 0.75 ml pure IAA in drum for 2 mins
        - ONLY for vaporous chemical exposures, not viruses. Even with fully sealed N95, the banana odor is noticeable
    - Saccharin Solution Aerosol Protocol
    - 83 grams of sodium saccharin to 100 ml of warm
water.
    - breathe through slightly open mouth with tongue
extended, and report if the sweet saccharin is tasted
- BITREX testing
- no statistically significant differences between the commercial and homemade solutions representing that participants detected the bitter taste of the BitrexTM and sweettaste of the saccharin solutions
- PAPRs do not depend on a tight seal with the face so do not need to be fit tested. more comfortable, since they are not tight-fitting. more protective than N95s, having a higher assigned protection factor (25 compared to 10)
- 
- self-testing https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/fuwr74/has_anyone_attempted_a_diy_n95_fit_test/
    - wearing glasses easy way to see if fit is ok. most fit issues are around the nose/upper cheeks
    - Block paths for air exit while exhaling. With a good fit, the mask is slightly pressurized before outward leakage.
    - Block paths for air entry while inhaling. With a good fit, the mask slightly collapses under negative pressure (for valved masks).

- Audibility: masks can reduce the intelligibility of the speech signal[58](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7[ref-CR58](<ref-CR58.md>)), and can reduce the intensity of sounds passed through them by a significant amount (e.g., > 10 dB in Saedi et al.[59](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7[ref-CR59](<ref-CR59.md>))). Likely as a response to this, people will speak louder and otherwise adjust their speech when wearing masks. Mendel et al.[60](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7[ref-CR60](<ref-CR60.md>)) found that the measured intensity of speech was approximately the same for a group of speakers with and without surgical masks, suggesting that speakers increased the actual intensity of their speech when wearing masks. Fecher[61](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7[ref-CR61](<ref-CR61.md>)) found that speakers will actually produce louder output through some types of masks in cases where they overestimate the dampening effects of the mask. It is also possible that speakers may produce Lombard speech when wearing certain types of masks[62](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7[ref-CR62](<ref-CR62.md>)). Lombard speech is louder, has a higher fundamental frequency, and tends to have longer vowel durations, all characteristics that may contribute to an increase in the emission of aerosols[48](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7[ref-CR48](<ref-CR48.md>)),[49](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7[ref-CR49](<ref-CR49.md>)). Our results showed that the root mean square amplitude of speech, as measured externally when participants wore any type of mask, equaled or exceeded that of the no-mask condition (Figure [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7[MOESM1](<MOESM1.md>))a), suggesting that participants were indeed talking louder with the mask.

    - Particle size is the most important determinant of aerosol behaviour
    - Small aerosol particles smaller than 5 μm in aerodynamic size are most likely to remain airborne for indefinite periods (unless there is removal due to air currents or dilution ventilation)
    - Infection control guidelines have stated that most respiratory infections are transmitted by respiratory droplets—ie, particles larger than 5–10 μm in size. Airborne transmission has been attributed to only a few pathogens, notably __Mycobacterium tuberculosis__, via infectious droplet nuclei that are particles sized 5 μm or smaller.
    - The studies reviewed in this paper consistently show that humans produce infectious aerosols in a wide range of particle sizes, but pathogens predominate in small particles (<5 μm that are immediately respirable by exposed individuals
    - Filtering facepiece respirators offer more respiratory protection than surgical masks, and powered air purifying respirator (PAPRs) hoods offer the best protection for most health-care settings.
    - Face shields do not offer inhalation protection against small particle aerosols
    - PAPRs have built-in eye protection. Surgical masks and other respirators require a face shield or goggles to protect the eyes to prevent infection

- Particulate Filter Efficiency Testing
- The maximum and minimum penetration value will be reported for the set of 10 respirators. If valves are present on the respirator, they will be sealed for testing. Each respirator will be tested on a TSI 8130 and/or 8130A Automated Filter Tester, set to the following parameters:
- While some of the test parameters listed are consistent with NIOSH Standard Test Procedure TEB-APR-STP-0059
(STP-0059), this modified test is different. Respirators assessed to this modified test plan do not meet the
requirements of STP-0059, and therefore cannot be considered equivalent to N95 respirators that were tested
to STP-0059. The values reported are only to provide an indication of filter efficiency and are not a confirmation
that the product conforms with the requirements of the certification mark. This assessment provides useful
information about the filter efficiency of respirators that may be used by healthcare workers in national
emergency situations.
