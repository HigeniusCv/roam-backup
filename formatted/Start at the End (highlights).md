    - Instead of starting at the end—a clearly described behavior that is the explicit goal of creation—our method of design has come to embrace the sexy sell and the need to sound good ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=105))
    - we make products with the advertisements in mind. ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=107))
    - what made the iPhone successful while other status quo challengers (the Kin, anyone?) fell utterly flat. ([Location 115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=115))
    - asking “Why would people want to do that in the first place?” and “Why aren’t they doing it already?” ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=119))
        - **Note**: 2 key questions
    - The first maps motivation to the conditions that make behavior more likely, called promoting pressures. The second helps us understand the factors (like “AIDS kills” stamps) that make the behavior less likely, called inhibiting pressures. ([Location 120](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=120))
    - what is a lab experiment but the attempt to create a reality precisely like this one but where one key thing is changed ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=128))
    - Despite a drumbeat of attention around behavioral science, I’m still one of only a few Chief Behavioral Officers in the world. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=151))
    - One more egalitarian note, to go with the cursing: You don’t need a PhD. I promise you, you don’t need a PhD. I don’t have a PhD and I’m as close to an expert as we have! ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=188))
    - Designing for habit and the reprogramming of the brain is simply unethical, as it explicitly circumvents our intentions by exploiting the brain’s need to save cognitive resources and create shortcuts. ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=195))
    - start with a potential insight—an observation about the distance between our current world and the counterfactual one in which we want to live. ([Location 240](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=240))
    - the world-as-is was being driven by the inhibiting pressures of teachers, ([Location 275](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=275))
    - suggesting the engineers call their moms and ask about search engines spying on people. Qualitative validation for the win! ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=290))
    - I taught eighth grade for a semester in order to get my teaching degree, and it was one of the most difficult ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=292))
    - “operationally dirty”: ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=301))
    - We got 40 percent more searches out of a simple product and some lesson plans, because we knew what behavior we wanted at the end ([Location 325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07L2HM12P&location=325))
