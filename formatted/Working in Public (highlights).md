    - Too many emails made us not want to answer. We were, effectively, DDoSing one another: the term for a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which malicious actors overwhelm their target by flooding it with traffic, leaving the victim incapacitated. Our online public lives became too much to handle, causing many of us to shrink back into our private spheres. ([Location 44](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=44))
        - **Note**: Problems With scale 
    - Initially, I focused my explorations on a lack of funding. Many open source developers are not directly paid for their work, ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=57))
    - The cycle looks something like this: Open source developers write and publish their code in public. They enjoy months, maybe years, in the spotlight. But, eventually, popularity offers diminishing returns. If the value of maintaining code fails to outpace the rewards, many of these developers quietly retreat to the shadows. ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=63))
    - However, in speaking to maintainers privately, I learned that these initiatives frequently cause them to seize with anxiety, because such initiatives often attract low-quality contributions. This creates more work for maintainers—all contributions, after all, must be reviewed before they are accepted. Maintainers ([Location 74](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=74))
    - there is no community behind the project at all, only individual efforts. ([Location 77](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=77))
    - Maintainers simply don’t have the energy to onboard every person who shows passing interest. Many told me they were frustrated by prior attempts to cater to a revolving door of contributors—sometimes ([Location 79](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=79))
    - in a sample of 275 popular GitHub projects across various programming languages, nearly half of all contributors only contributed once. ([Location 85](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=85))
    - Bootstrap, a popular design framework used by an estimated 20% of all websites,4 where three developers have authored over 73% of commits. ([Location 91](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=91))
    - This distribution—where one or a few developers do most of the work, followed by a long tail of casual contributors, and many more passive users—is now the norm, not the exception, in open ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=99))
    - in more than 85% of the open source projects the researchers examined on GitHub, less than 5% of developers were responsible for over 95% of code and social interactions. ([Location 103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=103))
        - **Note**: Law of lurking 
    - the bus factor, where project health is measured by the number of developers that would need to get hit by a bus before the project is in trouble. ([Location 107](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=107))
    - what if we start from the premise that things are as they should be? I decided to revisit the diagnosis, treating these symptoms as a starting point, instead of applying the only prescription—more participation—that we had. ([Location 112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=112))
    - mille-feuille layer cake of little libraries instead of one big, jiggling Jell-O mold. Today, ([Location 114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=114))
    - npm ecosystem—which, according to its parent company, makes up an estimated 97% of the code in modern web applications today—offers some clues to the future.8 Npm, which stands for Node Package Manager, is the platform commonly used by JavaScript developers to install and manage packages, ([Location 117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=117))
    - Casual contributors are often aware that they have little context for what is going on behind the scenes of the project. But more importantly, they do not want to spend time familiarizing themselves with a project’s goals, roadmap, and contribution process. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=126))
    - maintainers are defined by the need for curation: sifting through the noise of interactions, such as user questions, bug reports, and feature requests, which compete for their attention. ([Location 130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=130))
    - These developers aren’t building communities; they’re directing air traffic. ([Location 135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=135))
    - SourceForge, the dominant code-hosting platform back in 2001, had just over 200,000 users at the time.9 Today, GitHub, its successor, claims over 40 million registered users, a number that has nearly doubled in just the past two years.10 ([Location 137](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=137))
    - it’s not the excessive consumption of code but the excessive participation from users ([Location 141](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=141))
    - If you read reviews on Amazon, you’re mostly reading reviews written by people like Grady Harp. If you read Wikipedia, you’re mostly reading articles written by people like Justin Knapp. . . . And if you read YouTube comments, you’re mostly reading comments written by people like Justin Young. If you consume any content on the Internet, you’re mostly consuming content created by people who for some reason spend most of their time and energy creating content on the Internet. ([Location 146](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=146))
    - Instead of facing one another, as pop culture critic Mark Fisher allegedly once put it, a creator’s audience now faces the stage. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=158))
    - annihilating. To be faced with all those people thinking and talking about me was like standing alone, at the center of a stadium, ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=169))
    - Even Wikipedia, the world’s biggest online encyclopedia, and a canonical example of large-scale collaboration, has Steven Pruitt, a volunteer who’s edited one-third of all the English language articles on the ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=198))
    - The fact that most open source developers now use GitHub represents more than just a shift in personal tastes; it also signifies a shift in developer culture. ([Location 217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=217))
    - Before there was a de facto platform for hosting code, most open source code was published as a “tarball” (named for the .tar file, which bundles files together) on some self-hosted, stand-alone website. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=222))
    - Before that, developers primarily used centralized version control systems, such as Subversion or CVS, if they used version control at all. These systems weren’t designed for decentralized collaboration at scale. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=229))
    - with distributed version control everybody can work on their own copy of the code separately, before synchronizing their changes with everyone else. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=231))
    - It’s not just Torvalds’s communication skills but also his governance style that helped him gain notoriety. In one of his essays, Raymond called this style “benevolent dictator,” ([Location 285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=285))
    - Although the Linux Foundation reports more than 14,000 contributors to the Linux kernel since 2005,24 Torvalds is still the only person who’s allowed to merge those contributions into the main project.25 Although there is no shortage of memorable hacker personalities, the free and early open source ethos is also defined by a startling lack of interest in its people.

    - my shoes,” we mean that we own them. We have the final say in decisions about our bike. But when we say “that’s my father” or “my sister,” what we mean is we’re associated with them. We obviously don’t possess them. ([Location 300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=300))
    - open source, you can only have “my” in the associative sense. There is no possessive “my” in open source. ([Location 301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=301))
    - GitHub’s community features—where all the conversations take place—are harder to export. ([Location 310](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=310))
    - If GitHub is like Facebook, SourceForge was the MySpace of code-hosting platforms: the first significant product of its kind, and, though still alive today, mostly remembered as a blueprint. ([Location 328](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=328))
    - GitHub’s friendly user experience helped boost interest in Git, which has a notoriously steep learning curve. ([Location 336](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=336))
    - GitHub incorporated every part of the developer workflow into its product, including issue trackers, developer profiles, and what it calls “pull requests”: a clean way to submit, review, and merge proposed contributions. ([Location 340](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=340))
    - GitHub’s popularity among modern developers is the classic technology tale of convenience triumphing over personal values. ([Location 362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=362))
        - **Note**: Convenience Kills values 
    - Thompson references a quote attributed to Bill Gates, who defines a platform as “when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it.”36 Based on this definition, Thompson suggests that Facebook is not actually a platform but an aggregator, ([Location 393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=393))
        - **Note**: Platform Non zero sum 
    - By focusing on the developer experience, GitHub made open source much more about people than projects, in what developer Mikeal Rogers calls the “amateurization of open source,” where “pushing code became almost as routine as tweeting”: ([Location 427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=427))
    - JavaScript, a language ecosystem that grew up on GitHub. ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=446))
    - Because JavaScript is the only language that modern browsers have a built-in engine to support, it has stayed relevant to developers ever since. ([Location 449](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=449))
    - HTML, a markup language, and CSS, a style sheet language, it formed the holy trinity of frontend development. HTML provided the scaffolding for webpages, CSS styled those elements, and JavaScript made them dynamic. ([Location 451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=451))
    - If a webpage is a building, HTML forms the bones, CSS the paint and drywall, and JavaScript the electricity and plumbing. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=452))
    - In 2009, Ryan Dahl released Node.js, a platform that made it easier to run JavaScript on both the client and server side. Now, instead of having to learn one language for the backend and another for the frontend of an application, developers could learn one language—JavaScript—and use it everywhere. ([Location 457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=457))
    - because JavaScript must maintain compatibility across browsers, its official core library is smaller than that of most other languages. So developers are forced to ([Location 469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=469))
    - customize it for themselves, writing their own packages to fill in the gaps. As a result, each project tends to be smaller and more disposable, like LEGO blocks that fit ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=470))
    - when code is small, it’s the people who stand out. JavaScript’s most recognizable developers are known for the talks they give, the videos they record, the tweets and blog posts they write. They command large followings ([Location 474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=474))
    - “a perverse effect where, the more successful you are, the more you get ‘punished’ with GitHub notifications.” ([Location 546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=546))
    - maybe platforms do a lot more for creators than we realize. ([Location 558](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=558))
    - documented extensively (nearly every decision is written down somewhere) but not clearly (you have to dig through years of mailing list archives to find what you need). ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=601))
    - Anyone can propose a change to an open source project in the form of a “patch”—or to use GitHub’s nomenclature, a pull request ([Location 634](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=634))
    - equivalent of having comment permissions on a shared document: anyone can suggest a change, but not everyone can actually approve it. ([Location 636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=636))
    - commit access, which is like being able to edit a shared document. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=638))
    - Bigger projects often use a formal “request for comments” (RFC) process to allow communities to discuss these changes before they are merged. ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=641))
    - an extensive onboarding process in which they are expected to read a manual, find a mentor, and meet a maintainer in person who can vouch for their identity. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=658))
    - Bitcoin’s community, like Clojure’s, prioritizes stability and security, preferring to move slowly and with ([Location 668](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=668))
    - Ethereum is more like Node.js: it’s a platform for others to develop on, flinging itself far and wide. It resembles a sprawling city like Los Angeles, ([Location 669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=669))
    - Reaching out through personal channels, such as private email, is generally considered rude, in ([Location 699](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=699))
    - While code is the final output of a project, the term “project” refers to the entire bundle of community, code, and communication and developer tools that support its underlying production. ([Location 712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=712))
    - GitHub can be broken into three parts: code (the final output of a project), an issue tracker (a way to discuss changes), and pull requests (a way to make changes). ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=729))
    - While some open source developers write code in public from the very beginning, many prefer to do their initial creative work in private, so they can properly articulate their ideas ([Location 759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=759))
    - One heuristic for when this transition occurs is when maintainers start doing more non-code than code work on the project, such as triaging issues and reviewing others’ pull requests. ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=787))
    - a project’s user and contributor bases grow at different rates, sometimes independently of one another. ([Location 807](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=807))
    - project’s contributor growth is a function of its technical scope, support required, ease of participation, and user adoption. ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=809))
    - responding to open issues or reviewing others’ pull requests. The former is considered to be “fun” work that potential contributors clamor to take on, but the latter is necessary work that tends to fall exclusively on maintainers. ([Location 820](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=820))
    - think of projects in terms of their contributor growth and user growth. This gives us four production models: federations, clubs, toys, and stadiums. ([Location 863](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=863))
    - Clubs are projects with high contributor growth and low user growth, ([Location 897](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=897))
        - **Note**: Blue Grass
    - In a club, most users are contributors: you’re either participating or you’re not in the club. ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=918))
        - **Note**: Yak 
    - Stadiums are projects with low contributor growth and high user growth. ([Location 934](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=934))
    - Jennifer Chambers, who streams herself knitting to a “modest, but steady group of viewers”: ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1015))
    - Ostrom identified eight design principles that contribute to a well-managed, successful commons: Membership boundaries are clearly defined. The rules that govern the commons should match the actual conditions. Those who are affected by these rules can participate in modifying them. Those who monitor the rules are either community members or are accountable to the community, rather than outsiders. Those who violate the rules are subject to graduated sanctions, which vary depending on the seriousness and context of the offense. Conflicts should be resolved within the community, using low-cost methods. External authorities recognize the right of community members to devise their own institutions. If the commons is part of a larger system, its governing rules are organized into multiple “nested” layers of authority. ([Location 1049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1049))
        - **Note**: Ostrom commons 
    - Members also have a low discount rate, which is another way of saying they have “skin in the game,” ([Location 1061](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1061))

    - Benkler reasons that if individuals are personally motivated to do something, coordination costs will be lower.111 Unlike companies—which need to solicit, evaluate, hire, and manage employees—the members of a commons simply self-organize based on who wants to do the work most. ([Location 1083](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1083))
    - A few of the conditions that Benkler identifies as necessary to pull off commons-based peer production are intrinsic motivation, modular and granular tasks, and low coordination costs. ([Location 1103](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1103))
    - Intrinsic motivation is the currency of the commons: members do the work because they want to do it. ([Location 1105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1105))
    - Coordination work is expensive because it’s not intrinsically motivated. ([Location 1125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1125))
    - as if the panopticon inverted itself overnight, as if a giant spotlight turned on and suddenly all of us performing on Facebook for approval realized we were all in the same auditorium, on one large, connected infinite stage, singing karaoke to the same audience at the same time.121 ([Location 1174](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1174))

    - MAINTAINERS are those who are responsible for the future of a project’s repository (or repositories), whose decisions affect the project laterally. Maintainers can be thought of as “trustees” or stewards of the code. CONTRIBUTORS are those who make contributions to a project’s repository, ranging from casual to significant, but who aren’t responsible for its overall success. USERS are those whose primary relationship to a project’s repository is to consume (or “appropriate”) its code.

    - existing code? The term “maintenance” seems to imply reactive work, whereas “core development” implies proactive work. Maintaining a minimum degree of functionality might include tasks like responding to issues, reviewing pull requests, and upgrading software dependencies. But actively evolving the project would require tasks like defining the vision of the project, writing new features, and reducing “scope creep” (not letting ([Location 1380](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1380))

    - Some projects aren’t actively developed anymore, but they are being maintained. ([Location 1398](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1398))
    - author refers specifically to the developer or developers who were responsible for the project’s original release. Not all authors become maintainers ([Location 1401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1401))

By contrast, the person I spoke to loves organizing, curating, and rigorously applying process. ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1423))
        - **Note**: Left v  right  brains
    - They work well together, although sometimes he wonders what will happen when the author eventually steps down. He worries he won’t be able to fill the shoes of an inventor. Likewise, if he were to step away from the project, finding someone with his level of patience and attention to detail would be difficult for his co-maintainer. ([Location 1424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1424))
    - Rarely is long-term maintenance primarily about sharpening one’s skills as a developer. If anything, maintainers sometimes stick with a project despite not learning from it or using the technology anymore. They might cite feelings of obligation, community, or helping ([Location 1445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1445))

([Location 1466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1466))
    - active contributors aren’t necessarily a function of how many users the project actually has, but rather of how many perceive that they can make a meaningful contribution. ([Location 1512](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1512))
    - incentives to participate differ between casual and active contributors from day one. ([Location 1524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08BDGXVK9&location=1524))
