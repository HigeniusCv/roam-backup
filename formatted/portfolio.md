- Feedback from JLo - having only recent work is suspicious. Too cut & pasty. Work on the narrative. Only show big impactful wins.  Also, ethically, clean out headshots, replace with clip art
- Future of Payments - break down the steps, following Leah's talk, and end with $2MM / annual behavioral win
- https://vimeo.com/91666220 MX 2014 | Leah Buley | The Marriage of Corporate & UX Strategy: A Case Study
- Open with a vivid description of the room itself, with a 30 ft long table, a lot of guys (CEO, CFO, GM of 3 of 4, "outside experts")
- Leah felt nauseated, but clearly  
- Great thinking, but what's missing is the customer perspective.
- Felt new-comer at the big table. That's gonna feel mighty, I've arrived, but it feels scary, earnest.
- Story of how Intuit got there. 
- [I'd include Kaaren's HBR story: https://hbr.org/2011/06/the-innovation-catalysts] 
- Horizon Planning at Intuit
    - H1 - Cash Cows, must continue to be leaders
    - H3 - Test out PMF, make sure customers want the thing
    - H2 is on its way
- D4D - Design for Delight as an Explicit Focus
- Design Innovation Group
    - doesn't sit in any 
    - future forward, too messy, or interdiscipline
- 2012 - Reimagine Payments
    - New ways to pay and get paid
    - New banking (unbanked or uncredited)
    - Data is the big currency
- Intuit needed to get on top of this
    - For small businesses, both invoicing and point of sale
    - For taxes, payments and refunds
    - For accounting, the stream of data
    - For banks, Intuit had a competitor to Yodlee, and could conceivably also white label payments offerings through 3,000 stodgy S&Ls and local bankds
- Payments - Classic strategy gambit
    - Within Intuit, large legacy base anchors innovation on incrementalism 
        - Cognitive bias - Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it 
    - Intuit's GoPayment beat Square to market with a mobile phone auditory signal processor, but could be compared to mp3 players before the iPod https://www.pcworld.com/article/239250/square_vs_intuit_gopayment_mobile_credit_card_systems_compared.html
- Outside partner: Intuit + IDEO
    - Gorgeous deliverables came from the studio's pixie dust

        - Land of Barcharts, sizing markets, competitive intelligence, revenue spreadsheets
        - Default tactic - if you're looking at barcharts, you anchor on imagining them getting bigger (up and to the right as a narrow preconceived path)
    - The CEO charged them with the task, Find More Revenue
        - Revenue gets to decide what the DJ plays
        - Also, their sponsor was from the top, a charismatic CEO
