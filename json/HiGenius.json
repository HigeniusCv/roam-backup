            "string": "The mismatch between the physical screen and our mental screen isn\u2019t going away. If anything, it\u2019s getting worse by the day. Here are a few questions every digital architect should ask themselves to ensure they aren\u2019t overwhelming their users by accident: 1. Have you thought about the limitations of attention when designing the layout of your Web site? If the magical number of the mind is less than four, then why do most sites fill our screen with dozens of options? Amazon, for instance, provides images of sixty different products on a twenty-seven-inch monitor. Indeed, one can fit a lot of information on a huge physical screen, but we have to remember the constraints of our much smaller mental screen. 2. Have you factored in the attentional environment? Our mental screen shrinks when we attend to multiple tasks. Here\u2019s one obvious suggestion: GPS screens in cars should adjust the amount of information displayed to our driving speed. When we are stopped at a red light, the screen can be fully functional, but if we\u2019re on the highway perhaps it should display nothing but the appropriate exit. 3. Have you looked for ways to compress information? My suggestion here is to consider using visuals instead of words whenever possible. 4. Have you considered ways to boost attention? As we will discuss in chapter 6, personalized videos grab a lot more attention than standard text formats. 5. Have you done a \u201cwhiteboard exercise\u201d? Nobody sets out to create an overly complicated Web site that overwhelms users. Rather, such sites evolve that way over time, as new features, links, and multimedia effects are gradually added. Unfortunately, we often become blind to the drawbacks of these additions, as we fall for the \u201cstatus quo bias.\u201d Thus, it\u2019s important to occasionally conduct a whiteboard exercise and design a new site that focuses only on the essential information. Notice that the best Web sites, such as Google, always try to strip away everything but the essential. ([Location\u00a0514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=514))",

As the latest research demonstrates, the visual appeal of a Web site is tied up with far weightier issues, such as functionality and trustworthiness. Here are a few questions to help you get the most out of a Web site\u2019s design: 1. Have you \u201cfast-tested\u201d your site? Remember, you have only fifty milliseconds to impress your visitors. Flash your Web site to people for a very short period of time and then ask for their opinion. That is the opinion that matters. 2. Have you considered the implications of the halo effect? Perhaps the best way to increase the perceived usability and trustworthiness of your site is to make it prettier. 3. Have you taken the asymmetric nature of complexity into account? It\u2019s always better to err on the side of simplicity. 4. Who are your users? Remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that different demographics prefer different Web site styles.

            "string": "ASK YOURSELF The digital age has likely amplified the importance of our visual biases. Unless you are taking these perceptual habits into account, you are missing a powerful opportunity to increase the impact of your information. After all, it\u2019s possible to make people look, but it\u2019s much better to be where they\u2019re already looking. To help you maximize the opportunity (that is, being in the hot spots) and minimize the risk (that is, being in the cold spots), I have compiled the following list of guiding questions. 1. Have you considered the middle bias? Just as items in the center are more likely to be chosen on a supermarket shelf, so does the placement of items on the screen dramatically affect our choices. For example, many people will select a snack they don\u2019t care for, merely because it is in the middle of the screen. 2. Have you considered the top-left bias? In situations where a middle choice doesn\u2019t exist\u2014say, a screen divided into a two-by-two matrix\u2014our eyes gravitate toward the top-left cell. 3. Have you considered potential cultural differences in display biases? My native language is Hebrew, which is read from right to left. I speculate that those used to reading right to left might gravitate toward the top-right cell. 4. Have you considered \u201ccold spots\u201d? There are hot spots on the screen, but there are also cold spots. In the Battleship game, for example, you want to hide your ships in the cold spots (which are the edges of the screen), because they are six times less likely to be selected than the middle of the screen. Of course, if you\u2019re an online retailer, then you don\u2019t want your high-margin items to be placed in the cold spots, as that will make them much less likely to be chosen. 5. Have you considered the possibility that visual biases might be enhanced on screens? In one study, the vast majority of radiologists missed a gorilla on CT scans they reviewed on screens. I suspect they might not have missed it so frequently on an old-fashioned film, but we obviously need a lot more research to test my hunch. 6. Have you considered the blind spots generated by zooming in? If you are an intelligence analyst searching for terrorists, you might be tempted to zoom in, but that means that a lot of the battlefield is being pushed to the edges, which are often our blind spots. You must think carefully about how you take that snapshot of the \u201cbattlefield,\u201d if only to ensure that you are not missing critical intelligence. 7. Have you considered the horizontal bias? Our retina is programmed to search the world horizontally. As a result, any information displayed in rows receives greater decision weight than information displayed in columns. 8. Have you factored in decision speed? The faster we search and choose, and the more we attempt to multitask, the stronger our visual biases are.

            "string": "The star attraction of Personal Capital is the dashboard, in which users can track their investment performance and spending behavior at a glance. For instance, the dashboard breaks down, by category, where the money goes; it shows you how much you spend at clothing stores and on entertainment, how much goes to transportation, and the percentage of income that\u2019s devoted to paying off the mortgage. What\u2019s more, this feedback can be accessed at any time, from nearly anywhere. Yaron and I were interested in how all this new financial information would impact the purchasing decisions of consumers. We focused on a subset of longtime Personal Capital users who downloaded the mobile app shortly after its release. Because these subjects had previously been visiting the Web site, we were able to focus on the impact of the app on their spending habits. The first thing we discovered is that app users got far more feedback. While Personal Capital Web users viewed their financial dashboard an average of 2.14 times per month before installing the app, that number jumped to 12.47 times per month after installation. It\u2019s important to note that this increase was entirely driven by new mobile views, as Web site visits stayed constant; the app was additive, and not a substitute. Here\u2019s the punch line: all of this new financial feedback significantly influenced people\u2019s spending decisions, with the typical app user decreasing their monthly spending by 15.7 percent. Not surprisingly, almost all of this decrease came in the form of discretionary spending, with users spending far less on items such as dining out.

But the psychological literature suggests that the deliberate use of disfluency can actually be quite helpful, at least when it comes to making us think more carefully about what\u2019s on the screen. 1. Before you decide on the ideal level of fluency, it\u2019s important to establish the goal of your digital information. a. Do you want people to complete a transaction or make a quick purchase? If so, then high levels of fluency are ideal. Make the process as easy as possible. b. Do you want people to remember what they read, as in a classroom? If so, then introduce a measure of disfluency to the content. Find ways to slow the mind down. c. Do you want people to reflect on the information, as in the case of mortgage rates or cigarette warnings? This also calls for a level of disfluency. 2. Are you leveraging the different types of disfluency? a. Have you been using visual disfluency? You might begin with font changes\u2014try using unfamiliar typefaces\u2014but should also consider new layouts. Find ways to make the eyes work a little bit harder. b. Have you considered cognitive disfluency? Examples include using \u201cfancy words,\u201d as my five-year-old, Maya, calls them, or forcing users to manually enter information, as in the case of Uber and surge pricing. 3. Have you prescribed the right dosage of disfluency? The balance is essential, as excessive ease might not grab attention, but too much difficulty can turn people away. Use A/B testing to identify the proper dose of disfluency. In addition, eye-tracking data might help pinpoint places where disfluency can be introduced to boost attention and reflection.

            "string": "ASK YOURSELF Personalization is one of the most important principles to keep in mind when providing information or offering choices to customers. The mind is an information-processing machine, but it is drawn to information that is tailored for its unique preferences, interests, history, and even location. (Web sites have a lot to learn from good waiters.) Here are a few questions to think about when trying to leverage the tools of digital personalization: 1. Are you using all the relevant data available to you? In particular, what do you know about your customers or clients and what can you do with it to personalize their experience? For instance, I\u2019m a very frequent flier with United Airlines, and they could easily use my birthdate to send me a happy birthday e-mail. But they don\u2019t. Interestingly, another Star Alliance airline, Turkish Airlines, does remember my birthday, even though I fly with them far less frequently than with United. It\u2019s a little gesture\u2014and it costs the airline nothing\u2014but I remember it. 2. Have you considered the fine line between personalization and violations of privacy? It is important to set a balanced approach. Too much digital personalization can also come off as creepy. 3. Are you personalizing more than the content? For example, the timing of messages can play a big role in their effectiveness, which is why the Behavioural Insights Team personalizes the content based on the time a Web site is viewed. Similarly, how can you make the most out of temporal landmarks, such as New Year\u2019s Day or birthdays? 4. Are you leveraging new technologies to boost the effectiveness of personalization? Consider personalized videos as well as new visualization techniques. For example, people are willing to save more for retirement if they see a digital rendering of their older self. 5. Do you need more than one Web site? Should you, for example, consider a different Web site for the morning, evening, and late night? Or, should you set different Web sites for different clients, say a \u201cquick\u201d version for those with limited attention and a \u201cdeep\u201d version for those who have more attention and interest in the topic? 6. Are you investing enough in digital personalization? Given the remarkable return on investment, should you spend more on personalization? 7. Are you aiming high enough with your digital personalization strategy? Our newfound ability to analyze huge amounts of data is enabling new forms of personalization. Amazon, for example, has filed a patent for an algorithm that allows the company to ship products before consumers even place their orders. That might seem crazy now, but it wasn\u2019t so long ago that we also would have laughed at the possibility of an algorithm telling us what movies we should watch.

For this chapter, I\u2019ve structured my questions as a \u201cchoice algorithm.\u201d The goal of the algorithm is to take a huge choice set\u2014say, 45, or 1,024, options\u2014down to an ideal consideration set of 41, or 4. 1. Your online shelf might have thousands of options, but have you given consumers the tools to find a suitable consideration set of, say, four alternatives? (Mathematically, think of this as reducing a set from 4MANY to 41.) 2. Have you considered the \u201ceasy-middle bias\u201d when setting the size of the consideration set? A consideration set of three or five options might steer people toward the middle option, whereas a consideration set of four options will likely trigger more thinking about trade-offs. 3. One useful approach to getting to a manageable consideration set involves the use of categories. Have you tried personalized categories? The digital environment offers many more ways to slice the shelf, which could be tailored to each individual. 4. Are you too worried about the number of clicks required during the decision-making process? While fewer clicks is preferable, the more critical insight is to make the clicks useful. 5. Have you considered choice tournaments to reduce the options from sixteen to four? Such tournaments can be especially helpful if the alternatives involve several different variables and trade-offs. (Mathematically, think of this as reducing a set of 42 to 41.) 6. Are you managing regret? Research shows that marking unattractive options \u201cDECLINED\u201d can enhance choice closure. It\u2019s a very low-cost way to increase consumer satisfaction. 7. Are you also considering attribute overload? Cognitive overload isn\u2019t caused only by the number of options\u2014it can also be triggered by the number and complexity of attributes. Displaying dozens of features of each health care plan, for instance, could result in confused users, even if the consideration set is just three or four options. 8. Are you trusting my advice too much? While there is a lot of research to back up my recommendations, it is equally important to test the actual user experience and choice quality and adjust the design accordingly.

If your slides are filled with text and bullet points, equations, and complex detailed graphs, your audience might strain to follow you and have difficulty understanding your message. In this case, you are not designing the presentation for your audience; you are designing the presentation for yourself. Keep this mantra in mind: Presenting is a fundamentally different form of communication than writing. Treating your presentation and your paper identically\u2014moving text into bullets, and copying and pasting tables and figures from the paper to the slides\u2014misses this important distinction, and sets your audience up for \u201cdeath by PowerPoint.\u201d It\u2019s clear this approach doesn\u2019t work: In his annual online survey, author David Paradi consistently finds that the top three things hated by audiences are when (1) the speaker reads the slides, (2) the slides contain full sentences, and (3) the text is too small. We can all relate to the experience of half-listening to a speaker drone on with slides full of text, recounting each bullet point in detail.

Orange t-shirt said \"Bearded & Ugly\" with machine guns festooning the text. The dude looked solid, lots of tattoos, and he was calmly telling 2 of the cops about the nuisance surveillance of a guy on the other side of the parking lot, with a white t. Mr Orange was within his rights, standing well off beyond the 100 ft mark, and as far as I could presume, he was just watching the polls. His buddy orbited, in a black t-shirt, lanky and peripherally monitoring the sitch. I video'd. Then, after, he asked his buddy for a water, and I went and gave him the only bottle that I gave away that day. I thanked him for doing his duty. Also, when a cop came over to ask what I was video'ing, I replied that Election Defense was a non-partisan group observing to make sure the laws were fairly enforced. Also, he already had this in hand, and I thanked him for his service.",

INDEPENDENT AND NOT SO INDEPENDENT WITNESSES The prosecution began its case by putting on families of the victims to do what Massachusetts law calls \u201chumanizing the proceedings.\u201d I have never been a fan of this. What they do is start the trial by calling a tearful family member to testify and entering into evidence a photograph of the victim. The trial begins with an obvious effort to pull the heartstrings and emotions of the jury. Before you go thinking that I\u2019m cold, look at it from this perspective: the law has a theory, which is that the jury should base its decision on the evidence, not on emotion. I cannot agree more with this concept. We do not want jurors making decisions based on emotion. I believe this concept took root in the 1960s, when criminal justice reform was enacted after a series of miscarriages of justice during the civil rights era. Dispensing justice based on emotion was another form of lynching. You aren\u2019t taking someone out of their cell and hanging them in front of the courthouse. But what you are doing is putting them on trial, making the jury angry about this horrible crime, and then pointing the finger at the accused. Someone must pay for this horrible crime. Recent case law has trended away from this line of thinking, and for good reason. Think about it this way: you have a prosecutor putting family members on the stand to evoke sympathy from the jury, yet at the end of the trial you have the judge instructing the jury that they are to base their decision on facts, not feelings. After the victims\u2019 families took the stand and offered little information about who could have committed this crime, the prosecution shifted focus to the crime scene.

Expanding on her earlier efforts at Hull House, Viola was formulating techniques to help disparate populations dramatize their shared problems. By then, she had developed a format. First she would split her players into two groups. The performing group would decide on a subject worthy of improvisation, play for two or three scenes for the second group, their audience, who in turn would respond to the scenes with feedback.
