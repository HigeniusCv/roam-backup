- Inspired by Nhi's [Frequently asked questions about quantitative user research](https://groups.google.com/g/design-user-research/c/3so4MeclWK0/m/Nf49w2pGAwAJ)
- This nudged me to host a zoom call Monday Mar 1 - 10amPT
- https://us02web.zoom.us/j/2020201511
- I looked over this list, and this topic comes up multiple times every year, penultimately [Michele Ronsen put together a list of 13 resources last Nov](https://groups.google.com/g/design-user-research/c/5zb1oYHvvD0/m/QvQ-sidTAwAJ)
- Here's a preview of what to consider discussing this Monday
- **Answers to a lot of recurrent questions (w links to posts from here)**
- ****
- **What survey skills should I definitely possess?**
- Master everything Annie Steele outlines in “[Principles of Effective Survey Design](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/survey-design-principles)”
- Note: Well-designed surveys give insight even with basic bar charts and cross-tabs (ie, the comparisons that come from contrasting say iOS v Android users)
- **What's the way UXRs with qualitative expertise collaborate withQuant Research?**
- Who and why are people do things gets greatly enriched by thick contextual understanding. Data science shows __activities__, but can't single handedly flesh out user assumptions, backgrounds, motivations, emotions, etc
- Surveys and experiments then leverage these insights. Even thick ethnographic details (assumptions, backgrounds, motivations, emotions) can eventually be quantified. Translating qualitative insights into structured questions can reveal the proportion of customers who think or feel X, relative weighting of differences. By online experiments, you can even learn whether interface A vs B has greater impact on shifting attitudes/preferences.
- **How much should UXRs who are trained in qualitative learn about Quant Research?**
- **Basic questions with cheat sheet answers**
- **__Sample Size __** Magic number of responses? [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/research/determine-sample-size/) has a handy calculator, without needing to think in detail (about the standard deviation of the population) by 385 is a conservative 95% confidence level, Margin of error +/- 5%
- **__Personas and Data__**
- Segmentation versus personas  Alan Cooper (inventor of the persona concept) on [difference between personas & segmentation](https://groups.google.com/g/design-user-research/c/zMqkH1Vt-lA/m/AfRcqPSKBwAJ)
- **__Visualizing User Journeys__**__ f__rom big data- Zachary Sam Zaiss. [Using Data Science to Quantify User Journeys](https://slideslive.com/38906336/using-data-science-to-quantify-user-journeys?subdomain=false)
- **__Statistical significance __**- Most people who reference p-values mis-use them. (Sam Zaiss collects some [Problems with P values ](https://www.slideshare.net/ZacharySamZaiss/uxpa-2016-mixed-methods-research-in-the-age-of-big-data/21?src=clipshare)) - Until you've been trained in all the way p-values are misused, don't use them.
- **__Outsourcing to a consulting firm__**  [If you want to hire a consulting firm ](https://groups.google.com/g/design-user-research/c/oK8wOMrPBM0/m/pImUHShms8EJ) Peerless Insights' Young Ko is praised
- **__Hiring a quant researcher __**Simply assess if they're good at helping you understand.
- Good deas from Jan Dittrich on [Interviewing Quant Candidates](https://groups.google.com/g/design-user-research/c/m9wmXnNoaUA/m/egzQpmx4AgAJ) : How do they deal with tricky statistical/methodological questions such as, Explain what "statistical significance" means (most people get this wrong, maybe me, too. The answers are interesting)
- If you've read all this in time, consider this UXR Conf talk at 3pm PT
- [UX in a number-heavy world: Strategies for better quant-and-qual collaborations](https://uxrconference.com/talks/jenny-lo-will-monge/)
- Reach out directly to me if you've any ideas or questions
