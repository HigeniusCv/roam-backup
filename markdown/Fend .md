- Habit Building Lego Bricks

 Triggers - moments that carry an intuitive and instantaneous association
   Keystone Habits (foundation that can provide a place to hang the new habit)

 Tiny Steps - smaller snowballs can start an avalanche
   Make it tiny. To create a new habit, you must first simplify the behavior. Make it tiny, even ridiculous. A good tiny behavior is easy to do — and fast. 

Precommitment - very specific planning for the very next step (Channel factor)

Immediately gratify step - Reward substitution (Milkman’s tie a “want” to a “should.” 
- Celebration as closure

Reminders (or better, Re-behavers) 
  Most people have turned off reminders from their phone

Socialize the shift (social contagion)
 Diverse behavioral changes  (e.g., smoking, weight loss, gratitude exercises)  people significantly boosted by others near

Forgive lapses
Kelly McG’s Willpower Instinct: Self-criticism is consistently associated with less motivation and worse self-control. It is also one of the single biggest predictors of depression, which drains both “I will” power and “I want” power.

  Beginning the day: 
	Grooming (Shower yourself; Brush your breathing)
	McMindfulness (Breathing exercise as calming moment. Good but itself unstable bc of novelty)
	
  Recurrent hooks: Inhale before you eat each meal
	Can [[Fend]] call for savoring the experience?

  Coffee klatsch: Link to another daily routine, esp’ly if conversation is a component

  Before entering closed spaces (conference rooms, elevators, trains, planes): 
	Meeting at the Well - higeni.us prototype stations at the front door

  Threatening alarms: Upon spotting a mask-hole? Danger is a great attention grabber, but it 

  Behavioral nudges: 

 Apple Watch integration could be supremely elegant - Breathe, Washing Tracker, 

 Celebration moments might also grab onto the behavioral shift

  How many of us really stop to smell the roses?  A: Not the majority

Uncertainties that need clarification:
 0- Am I [[Fend]]ing for myself, or am I fencing off the threat for our group?
 1- Can you [[Fend]] excessively? What’s the impact of doing 12X/day?
 2- Does CaCl interact with taste buds? 
 3- Mandate vs Opt-in? 
 4- Shouldn’t hands be washed beforehand?
5- Can it be done w/o taking mask off? 

 
Misc:Fear-based appeals are worse than ritualizing control over one's environment. Aromatherapy is a natural extension to make it more esthetic. Breathing exercises, integration with Apple watch. Ritual construction is another on-ramp.
