- Wormald et al., using 5 mL Tc99m-labeled irrigation solution, found better nasal cavity and sinus distribution with douche administration than nebulization or sprays [[Fend]] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879729615001003
- __in vitro__ at least, it would seem that limited sodium chloride content is important for nasal irrigation solutions. Conversely, calcium provides an advantage in terms of restoring epithelial trophicity and mucociliary efficacy.
- Ringer's lactate, which is rich in calcium and potassium and less rich in sodium and chloride ions than isotonic saline, provided a stronger increase in [mucociliary transport](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/mucociliary-transport) than isotonic saline
- Administering nebulized isotonic saline to these “high-producer” individuals diminishes the number of exhaled bioaerosol particles expired by 72.10 ± 8.19% for up to 6 h. __In vitro__ and __in vivo__ experiments with saline and surfactants suggest that the mechanism of action of the nebulized saline relates to modification of the physical properties of the airway-lining fluid, notably surface tension.https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/101/50/17383.full.pdf
- small-scale sample population of 10 volunteers, including five who are above 65, and five who are below that age  https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/qrb-discovery/article/new-natural-defense-against-airborne-pathogens/69B51F1901AB4B9F808CAECBB29503D2
- ion type and not tonicity itself is critical to effectiveness, and that calcium, with a strong synergistic effect of NaCl, was the primary active ingredient. CaCl2 alone was also less effective, suggesting perhaps a secondary chloride role
