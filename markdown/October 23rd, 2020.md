- **Goals meeting with Lynette Bye**
    -  Prioritize work that will get me clients or full-time job
- How did your action items from our last call go?
- __If you didn’t complete some, why not? __
    - Top priority worked out - 2 strong leads:
        - Gusto.com for Lead Research
        - FEND aerosol client
    - R, as A1, did get sufficient and even more attention. The amount that looks necessary to learn the programming is ~10 hours a week
    - Signed onto too many things - Prioritization did enable me to push off lower priorities
- What do you want to get out of this call?
- __What would you like to talk about today? What would most increase your productivity this week?__
    - Some more structure around
        - Work hours
        - Rest hours - exercise & drawing
- (Optional) Are there any important takeaways from the last call that you want to remember?
- __Or habits that worked particularly well?__
    - The not-to-do, of no news or RSS/twitter, is a very powerful practice. Thurs morning demo’d this, when I frittered away 60+ mins in the morning as a cheat “before work”
        - StayFocusd Chrome extension potent
        - FocusMate is fraying - Booking more than the day of the sessions sets them too far ahead, and they can slip off the radar

- **10/16**
