    - Sleep last night pretty fitful
        - Early bedtime, felt tired
        - Woke at 4pm, worried for a long while
            - Especially concerned about Ricardo, but tried not to enmesh myself

    - Being [[smober]] since [[September 7th, 2020]] continues to pay a lot of benefits - better dinners, better conversation, less solitary mooning about, more focused output
    - Desire to fix the bathroom sink trap creates a tangential 
        - {{[[DONE]]}}  get a bigger wrench and find the trap
            - Amazon will ship by [[October 8th, 2020]]
