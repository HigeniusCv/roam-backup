- [[journal]][[October 7th, 2020]]{{[[POMO]]: 15}}
    - woke around 8, felt tired but not exhausted on both ends, midnight and 7ish
        - didn't leave bed for the first hour, so perhaps I slept more, since no distinct thoughts recalled
    - fiddled from 8 to 9 before exhorting B to wake up 
        - he won the Rip van Winkle prize in his advisory
    - ordered a $225 bubble head mask, in order to be able to fly someday
    - not at all restrained in my eating habits - t-bone for lunch, and mid-afternoon ice cream pint
    - writing has been happening, although not the full 2 hours
    - by around 4pm, i'd run out of clear todos, and went shopping, as well as dipping into my feed bag - may have even invented a pretext with Y to check whether IT in White House was dead
        - insanity - refusal to wear the mask has almost completely shut down the executive branch, the guy is on a roid rage that amps our collective danger, and for the debates, both he & VP are weaponized vectors who demand that the Dem show up without prudent protection
        - truly the worst-est is still ahead
    - i tweeted this AM about the paperclip factory
    - Now that ROAM is my repository, I want to ingest all my tweets, old notes, etc
    - in my [[Autobio 0 Draft]], I'm tempted to drop into my Harvard notes, and scan pages and even offer to digitize audio if an audience is created
        - I'm going to do a little more once my tomato bings
    - Per my senescent awakening, again chastened by the belated but useful power of finally setting clear goals
