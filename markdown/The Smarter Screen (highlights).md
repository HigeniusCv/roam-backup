    - The mismatch between the physical screen and our mental screen isn’t going away. If anything, it’s getting worse by the day. Here are a few questions every digital architect should ask themselves to ensure they aren’t overwhelming their users by accident: 1. Have you thought about the limitations of attention when designing the layout of your Web site? If the magical number of the mind is less than four, then why do most sites fill our screen with dozens of options? Amazon, for instance, provides images of sixty different products on a twenty-seven-inch monitor. Indeed, one can fit a lot of information on a huge physical screen, but we have to remember the constraints of our much smaller mental screen. 2. Have you factored in the attentional environment? Our mental screen shrinks when we attend to multiple tasks. Here’s one obvious suggestion: GPS screens in cars should adjust the amount of information displayed to our driving speed. When we are stopped at a red light, the screen can be fully functional, but if we’re on the highway perhaps it should display nothing but the appropriate exit. 3. Have you looked for ways to compress information? My suggestion here is to consider using visuals instead of words whenever possible. 4. Have you considered ways to boost attention? As we will discuss in chapter 6, personalized videos grab a lot more attention than standard text formats. 5. Have you done a “whiteboard exercise”? Nobody sets out to create an overly complicated Web site that overwhelms users. Rather, such sites evolve that way over time, as new features, links, and multimedia effects are gradually added. Unfortunately, we often become blind to the drawbacks of these additions, as we fall for the “status quo bias.” Thus, it’s important to occasionally conduct a whiteboard exercise and design a new site that focuses only on the essential information. Notice that the best Web sites, such as Google, always try to strip away everything but the essential. ([Location 514](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=514))
    - ASK YOURSELF For too long, aesthetics has been dismissed as a superficial concern. That is a mistake. As the latest research demonstrates, the visual appeal of a Web site is tied up with far weightier issues, such as functionality and trustworthiness. Here are a few questions to help you get the most out of a Web site’s design: 1. Have you “fast-tested” your site? Remember, you have only fifty milliseconds to impress your visitors. Flash your Web site to people for a very short period of time and then ask for their opinion. That is the opinion that matters. 2. Have you considered the implications of the halo effect? Perhaps the best way to increase the perceived usability and trustworthiness of your site is to make it prettier. 3. Have you taken the asymmetric nature of complexity into account? It’s always better to err on the side of simplicity. 4. Who are your users? Remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that different demographics prefer different Web site styles. Is it time to personalize the look of your Web site and app? ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=845))
    - This change in the layout—arranging alternatives either by brand or by attribute—dramatically altered the ways in which the women assessed their options. When the information was organized by attribute, the women searched along those lines; the opposite occurred when the cereals were organized by brand. Although traditional theories of consumer choice focus on making information available to consumers, Bettman and Kakkar pointed out that the format of the information is just as important. ([Location 1018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=1018))
    - Perhaps the most important of these visual movement biases involves a strong built-in preference for moving from side to side, in a sweeping horizontal motion. ([Location 1026](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=1026))
    - different formats led to very different styles of information processing. When the products were in horizontal rows, the typical user focused less on the attributes and spent more time (relatively speaking) looking at the products. In contrast, putting attributes in horizontal rows led subjects to compare a single attribute, such as price or processing power, across various models. Interestingly, the choices of the subjects were tightly correlated with the cascades of their gaze, as attributes and products that received more visual attention proved more influential.

    - ASK YOURSELF The digital age has likely amplified the importance of our visual biases. Unless you are taking these perceptual habits into account, you are missing a powerful opportunity to increase the impact of your information. After all, it’s possible to make people look, but it’s much better to be where they’re already looking. To help you maximize the opportunity (that is, being in the hot spots) and minimize the risk (that is, being in the cold spots), I have compiled the following list of guiding questions. 1. Have you considered the middle bias? Just as items in the center are more likely to be chosen on a supermarket shelf, so does the placement of items on the screen dramatically affect our choices. For example, many people will select a snack they don’t care for, merely because it is in the middle of the screen. 2. Have you considered the top-left bias? In situations where a middle choice doesn’t exist—say, a screen divided into a two-by-two matrix—our eyes gravitate toward the top-left cell. 3. Have you considered potential cultural differences in display biases? My native language is Hebrew, which is read from right to left. I speculate that those used to reading right to left might gravitate toward the top-right cell. 4. Have you considered “cold spots”? There are hot spots on the screen, but there are also cold spots. In the Battleship game, for example, you want to hide your ships in the cold spots (which are the edges of the screen), because they are six times less likely to be selected than the middle of the screen. Of course, if you’re an online retailer, then you don’t want your high-margin items to be placed in the cold spots, as that will make them much less likely to be chosen. 5. Have you considered the possibility that visual biases might be enhanced on screens? In one study, the vast majority of radiologists missed a gorilla on CT scans they reviewed on screens. I suspect they might not have missed it so frequently on an old-fashioned film, but we obviously need a lot more research to test my hunch. 6. Have you considered the blind spots generated by zooming in? If you are an intelligence analyst searching for terrorists, you might be tempted to zoom in, but that means that a lot of the battlefield is being pushed to the edges, which are often our blind spots. You must think carefully about how you take that snapshot of the “battlefield,” if only to ensure that you are not missing critical intelligence. 7. Have you considered the horizontal bias? Our retina is programmed to search the world horizontally. As a result, any information displayed in rows receives greater decision weight than information displayed in columns. 8. Have you factored in decision speed? The faster we search and choose, and the more we attempt to multitask, the stronger our visual biases are.

    - What did Kluger and DeNisi find? While feedback interventions improved performance on average, in about 38 percent of cases the feedback actually led people to do worse. The dieters gained weight; the students struggled to learn; the workers were less productive. It’s a sobering finding, a reminder of just how hard it is to structure effective feedback.

    - The star attraction of Personal Capital is the dashboard, in which users can track their investment performance and spending behavior at a glance. For instance, the dashboard breaks down, by category, where the money goes; it shows you how much you spend at clothing stores and on entertainment, how much goes to transportation, and the percentage of income that’s devoted to paying off the mortgage. What’s more, this feedback can be accessed at any time, from nearly anywhere. Yaron and I were interested in how all this new financial information would impact the purchasing decisions of consumers. We focused on a subset of longtime Personal Capital users who downloaded the mobile app shortly after its release. Because these subjects had previously been visiting the Web site, we were able to focus on the impact of the app on their spending habits. The first thing we discovered is that app users got far more feedback. While Personal Capital Web users viewed their financial dashboard an average of 2.14 times per month before installing the app, that number jumped to 12.47 times per month after installation. It’s important to note that this increase was entirely driven by new mobile views, as Web site visits stayed constant; the app was additive, and not a substitute. Here’s the punch line: all of this new financial feedback significantly influenced people’s spending decisions, with the typical app user decreasing their monthly spending by 15.7 percent. Not surprisingly, almost all of this decrease came in the form of discretionary spending, with users spending far less on items such as dining out.

    - consumers with access to their financial information on mobile phones check their balances before making large purchases. Of those who check, 50 percent decide not to buy an item because of the feedback.3 It only makes sense, then, that making this information far easier to access, and giving consumers information about all of their accounts in one place, would lead to even more responsible spending habits.

    - Hildebrand looked at how feedback on social media influenced the kind of car people chose. In general, he says, customers who heard back from other people tended to pick cars and options (such as exterior color) that were far less distinctive. Instead of buying the bright yellow roadster, they settled for the gray sedan. They conformed to the crowd. ([Location 1294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=1294))

    - The GlowCap works like this: After a patient fills a prescription, the Internet-connected plastic top automatically downloads his or her prescription details.43 Let’s say, for instance, that you’re suffering from high blood pressure and have been prescribed a medication to be taken twice a day, starting at seven a.m. After the clock strikes seven, the GlowCap begins emitting an orange light. If the pill bottle isn’t opened within a few minutes, then the GlowCap starts to emit a ring tone as well. As the minutes pass, the tones grow louder and more insistent. (David Rose, the inventor of the GlowCap, refers to this process as one of “escalating reminders.”44) This will continue for another two hours. If the pill bottle still isn’t opened, then the GlowCap will send an alert to its servers, followed by an automated e-mail and text to the patient. This system of gradual escalation—making sure that the tone of the feedback reflects the urgency of the situation—seems to be quite effective, at least for helping people take their medications. Because the GlowCap steadily raises the emotional stakes (a light becomes a flash, which becomes an annoying beep, which leads to an urgent text), ([Location 1483](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=1483))

    - errors were not as educational as they should have been. Instead of grappling with their mistakes, the surgeons seemed to blame external factors beyond their control, which inhibited their future progress. However, there was a very interesting pattern hidden in the results. It turned out that doctors saw big boosts in their own success rates when they watched a colleague fail at the new surgery. In other words, they were good at learning from the screwups of others, and terrible at learning from their own screwups. This has clear implications for digital feedback.

They’ve always been a useful memory compression device for me, helping my brain recall a complex process with a single cue. Below, I’ve recast my seven behavioral principles as an acrostic for the word DIGITAL. Dosage: Are you delivering too much feedback? Don’t become noise. I: Are you making personalization easy? Mirrors should be effortless. Good: Is your feedback too negative? If so, look for opportunities to offer up positive suggestions. Intuitive: Are you taking advantage of the affect heuristic? We are intuitively drawn to information that triggers an emotion. Timing: Are you delivering your feedback at the most effective possible moment? Actionable: Do people know how to react to your feedback? Does it come with a plan for improvement? Learning: Are you measuring the outcome of your feedback? Is it improving behavior? Never underestimate the uncertainty involved when trying to change human behavior. ([Location 1551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=1551))

    - the U.S. government partnered with H&R Block to create software capable of automatically filling in about a third of the application based on available family tax returns. This simple intervention came with impressive results, at least for the students in the study. After H&R Block made the forms easier to complete, students were 39 percent more likely to submit a loan application. Even more impressive, receiving help with the autofill on the application increased college enrollment among graduating high school seniors by almost 30 percent.9 ([Location 1640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=1640))

    - ASK YOURSELF The digital world tends to assume that high levels of fluency are always better—when in doubt, make it easy. But the psychological literature suggests that the deliberate use of disfluency can actually be quite helpful, at least when it comes to making us think more carefully about what’s on the screen. 1. Before you decide on the ideal level of fluency, it’s important to establish the goal of your digital information. a. Do you want people to complete a transaction or make a quick purchase? If so, then high levels of fluency are ideal. Make the process as easy as possible. b. Do you want people to remember what they read, as in a classroom? If so, then introduce a measure of disfluency to the content. Find ways to slow the mind down. c. Do you want people to reflect on the information, as in the case of mortgage rates or cigarette warnings? This also calls for a level of disfluency. 2. Are you leveraging the different types of disfluency? a. Have you been using visual disfluency? You might begin with font changes—try using unfamiliar typefaces—but should also consider new layouts. Find ways to make the eyes work a little bit harder. b. Have you considered cognitive disfluency? Examples include using “fancy words,” as my five-year-old, Maya, calls them, or forcing users to manually enter information, as in the case of Uber and surge pricing. 3. Have you prescribed the right dosage of disfluency? The balance is essential, as excessive ease might not grab attention, but too much difficulty can turn people away. Use A/B testing to identify the proper dose of disfluency. In addition, eye-tracking data might help pinpoint places where disfluency can be introduced to boost attention and reflection. Focus on the part of the screen that the eyes skim over. ([Location 1827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=1827))

    - When the instructions were not personalized, students gave the game an average score of 2.9 on a 1-to-7 scale of enjoyment. In contrast, when the same game began with a personalized introduction, they gave the game an average score of 5.42. They were also nearly twice as likely to stay after class in order to play the game. All this extra pleasure came with big benefits, as students in the personalized condition scored more than 30 percent higher on a subsequent math test. According to Cordova and Lepper, personalization enhances our attention and enjoyment for two reasons. The first reason is that it increases levels of intrinsic motivation. Because the information seems “self-relevant”—the students understood how it related to them—they were willing to invest the extra effort required to solve harder math problems. The second reason involves a factor known as “perceived competence,” as subjects exposed to personalized ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=1889))

    - ASK YOURSELF Personalization is one of the most important principles to keep in mind when providing information or offering choices to customers. The mind is an information-processing machine, but it is drawn to information that is tailored for its unique preferences, interests, history, and even location. (Web sites have a lot to learn from good waiters.) Here are a few questions to think about when trying to leverage the tools of digital personalization: 1. Are you using all the relevant data available to you? In particular, what do you know about your customers or clients and what can you do with it to personalize their experience? For instance, I’m a very frequent flier with United Airlines, and they could easily use my birthdate to send me a happy birthday e-mail. But they don’t. Interestingly, another Star Alliance airline, Turkish Airlines, does remember my birthday, even though I fly with them far less frequently than with United. It’s a little gesture—and it costs the airline nothing—but I remember it. 2. Have you considered the fine line between personalization and violations of privacy? It is important to set a balanced approach. Too much digital personalization can also come off as creepy. 3. Are you personalizing more than the content? For example, the timing of messages can play a big role in their effectiveness, which is why the Behavioural Insights Team personalizes the content based on the time a Web site is viewed. Similarly, how can you make the most out of temporal landmarks, such as New Year’s Day or birthdays? 4. Are you leveraging new technologies to boost the effectiveness of personalization? Consider personalized videos as well as new visualization techniques. For example, people are willing to save more for retirement if they see a digital rendering of their older self. 5. Do you need more than one Web site? Should you, for example, consider a different Web site for the morning, evening, and late night? Or, should you set different Web sites for different clients, say a “quick” version for those with limited attention and a “deep” version for those who have more attention and interest in the topic? 6. Are you investing enough in digital personalization? Given the remarkable return on investment, should you spend more on personalization? 7. Are you aiming high enough with your digital personalization strategy? Our newfound ability to analyze huge amounts of data is enabling new forms of personalization. Amazon, for example, has filed a patent for an algorithm that allows the company to ship products before consumers even place their orders. That might seem crazy now, but it wasn’t so long ago that we also would have laughed at the possibility of an algorithm telling us what movies we should watch.

    - Now comes the tournament condition. In this shopper’s version of Wimbledon, there were four rounds, each of which consisted of four new options. After seeing all of the options, people then made their final selection from the four previously selected decks. When the choices were presented like this, subjects were able to successfully locate the ideal deck 48 percent of the time. In other words, they were more than twice as likely to identify the best option. That’s a huge increase. ([Location 2412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=2412))

    - In a 2013 paper, Yangjie Gu, Simona Botti, and Faro showed how even minor physical acts (such as putting a lid over a cake) can give us a little closure on a difficult choice, and thus prevent a downward spiral of regret.25 ([Location 2469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00P891E4E&location=2469))

    - ASK YOURSELF In the digital age, we have more choice than ever before. We might also be choosing worse than ever before. For this chapter, I’ve structured my questions as a “choice algorithm.” The goal of the algorithm is to take a huge choice set—say, 45, or 1,024, options—down to an ideal consideration set of 41, or 4. 1. Your online shelf might have thousands of options, but have you given consumers the tools to find a suitable consideration set of, say, four alternatives? (Mathematically, think of this as reducing a set from 4MANY to 41.) 2. Have you considered the “easy-middle bias” when setting the size of the consideration set? A consideration set of three or five options might steer people toward the middle option, whereas a consideration set of four options will likely trigger more thinking about trade-offs. 3. One useful approach to getting to a manageable consideration set involves the use of categories. Have you tried personalized categories? The digital environment offers many more ways to slice the shelf, which could be tailored to each individual. 4. Are you too worried about the number of clicks required during the decision-making process? While fewer clicks is preferable, the more critical insight is to make the clicks useful. 5. Have you considered choice tournaments to reduce the options from sixteen to four? Such tournaments can be especially helpful if the alternatives involve several different variables and trade-offs. (Mathematically, think of this as reducing a set of 42 to 41.) 6. Are you managing regret? Research shows that marking unattractive options “DECLINED” can enhance choice closure. It’s a very low-cost way to increase consumer satisfaction. 7. Are you also considering attribute overload? Cognitive overload isn’t caused only by the number of options—it can also be triggered by the number and complexity of attributes. Displaying dozens of features of each health care plan, for instance, could result in confused users, even if the consideration set is just three or four options. 8. Are you trusting my advice too much? While there is a lot of research to back up my recommendations, it is equally important to test the actual user experience and choice quality and adjust the design accordingly.

At such moments, it might be helpful to have the gadget prompt you to think of reasons why you might want to save instead of spend.
