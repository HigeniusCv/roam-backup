    - What a hopeless, idiotic occupation—to try to scramble up a bare wall, ([Location 382](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=382))
    - In this way another day passed, and another night, and yet another day and a night. I had completely ceased to exist. All that was left was an all-consuming desire to climb that wall. My nails were broken and bleeding, my fingers were swollen, and by night time I was usually so exhausted that it took me several attempts to clamber up the boards. I used to slip off, fall down, get up again, and again lunge for the light, like an insect drawn to a lamp. I could no longer feel anything, neither cold nor pain nor hunger—there was nothing left but desire, a desire that was outside of me and apart from me: an overwhelming desire to climb that damned wall and reach that blasted light bulb. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=387))
        - **Note**: Ambitions Overcome boredom 
    - the main thing was that I now knew it could be done. It could be done even by me, with my lack of height, strength, and knowledge of climbing. I spent two more days on the assault. By the end of the fifth day I had achieved victory. Never in my life have I had a greater achievement, or one of which I was prouder. After that I used to clamber up three times a day just to light a tiny fag end. And it became such a normal part of my everyday life that it no longer even broke the monotony, ([Location 396](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=396))
    - set myself the task of constructing a castle in every detail, from the foundations, floors, walls, staircases, and secret passages right up to the pointed roofs and turrets. I carefully cut each individual stone, covered the floor with parquet or stone flags, filled the apartments with furniture, decorated the walls with tapestries and paintings, lit candles in the chandeliers and smoking torches in the endless corridors. I decked the tables and invited guests, listened to music with them, drank wine from crystal goblets, ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=402))
    - was not unknown for me to spend several days trying to decide a single question, such as what picture to hang in the drawing room, what cabinets to put in the library, what table to have in the dining room. Even now, with my eyes closed, I can retrace ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=411))
    - I built it between interrogations in Lefortovo, in the camp lockup, and in the Vladimir punishment cells. It saved me from apathy, from indifference to living. It saved my life. Because one must not let oneself be paralyzed; one cannot afford to be apathetic ([Location 415](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=415))
    - they won’t put it to you point-blank, suggesting you collaborate. They need much less than that for now—just some trivial concessions. They simply want to accustom you to making concessions, to the idea of compromise. ([Location 422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=422))
    - Somewhere along the line it seems to have been forgotten that the original aim of prison was to frighten not the prisoners but those who remained at liberty, that is to say, society itself. The more society tortures the prisoner, the more it is able to frighten itself. Consequently it craves the prisoner’s fear. ([Location 456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=456))
    - Apathy will whisper in your ear: “The main thing is to survive, think only of today, thank God you’re still alive.” ([Location 504](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=504))
    - Most of the prisoners used to learn some language or other: the Jews, as a rule, studied Hebrew, while the rest studied English, German, or Spanish. The method we used was the simplest possible, namely to read as many books as we could with the help of a dictionary, write down the new vocabulary, and sit and learn it. ([Location 506](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=506))
    - indeed, like all Interior Ministry employees, they hated the KGB’s guts. So ([Location 522](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=522))
    - no one ever looked at them and nobody knew that they included non-Soviet editions; if they had, no amount of hunger-striking would have helped me. It was simply that my sack irritated the prison officers. “This ([Location 531](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=531))
    - The safest thing was simply to read the book fast and copy as much as you could into your notebook. Such notes were considered a con’s private property, ([Location 543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=543))
    - Our main instruments, without which no amount of resourcefulness would have helped us, were undoubtedly solidarity and publicity. ([Location 549](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=549))
    - In my day there were no more than ten to twenty thousand of us political prisoners in the entire country, about the same number as used to die in Norilsk in the course of a single winter. But the West had long since got wind of the fact that its own fate and its own future were in some part being decided within the walls of Vladimir Prison. ([Location 555](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=555))
    - The world became interested in the question of whether you could have a prison with a human face. This for us was highly topical—prison we had known for ages, but the human face was exactly what was missing. And so it came about that sometimes we had barely finished one of our regular hunger strikes when the guards whispered to us the contents of some broadcast by the BBC or Radio Liberty on the subject of that very same strike; even they were intrigued by this radio war. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=559))
    - Better just to pass the buck to your superiors and wait for instructions. At the top they were in no hurry to issue instructions. ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=570))
    - put a bit too much pressure on, you had a hunger strike on your hands. And then you had London, Munich, Washington kicking up a stink again, which meant a Moscow commission on your backs within a few weeks. ([Location 574](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=574))
        - **Note**: The Effective impact depending on caring what the West thought 
    - it was not rifles, not tanks, and not atom bombs that created power, nor upon them that power rested. Power depended upon public obedience, upon a willingness to submit. Therefore each individual who refused to submit ([Location 581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=581))
    - They no longer demanded of people a belief in the radiant future—all they needed was submission. ([Location 585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=585))
    - Every complaint has to be forwarded by the prison administration within three days of its receipt. In the interim, the administration has to write an explanation to accompany the complaint, ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=612))
    - All you have to do is to know the law and the system under which complaints are examined; have a detailed knowledge of all the regulations pertaining to the prison regime; and compose your complaint so that it is brief and to the point, preferably on not more than a single page—otherwise no one will read it. ([Location 621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=621))
    - If you want your complaint to be examined by a high official, complain about his immediate subordinate. ([Location 625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=625))
    - complaining one rung higher each time about the reply received from the person immediately below. You should never complain about two different matters in the same letter. ([Location 627](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=627))
    - At the height of our war, each of us wrote from ten to thirty complaints a day. Composing thirty complaints in one day is not easy, so we usually divided up the subjects among ourselves and each man wrote on his own subject ([Location 630](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=630))
    - This goes on for months and months, until, at last, the most powerful factor of all in Soviet life enters the fray—statistics. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=648))
    - Sometimes two different offices gave diametrically opposed answers to the same complaint, and then we would set them at one another’s throats. ([Location 674](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=674))
    - But they surrendered. In 1977 the siege was lifted after two years of struggle. ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=682))
    - Our victory cost us dear. The prisoners were all gaunt and skinny, at death’s door ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=688))
    - They were absolutely astonished that people could go to prison just like that, deliberately and not for gain. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=750))
    - take on the job of tailing you. You might ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=1701))
    - important truth: you cannot achieve democracy by going underground. The underground produces only tyranny, only Bolsheviks of a different color. ([Location 1850](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=1850))
        - **Note**: Underground Fail
    - foreman had told him the total, he only pretended to work. Then, when the foreman wasn’t around, he would creep up to the big wooden shed where the finished parts were kept. There were two loose boards at the back. Nipping inside, he would quickly locate the boxes he needed in the dark and stuff his pockets with the necessary parts. Then he returned to the workshop by a roundabout route and spent most of the rest of the working day in the smoking room. I ([Location 1880](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=1880))
        - **Note**: Theft Beat honest working 
    - Paint, enamel, spare engine parts were taken as a matter of course. At the same time the entire factory was festooned with colorful signs and slogans—“We’ll give! We’ll catch up! We’ll overtake!”—together with rising production graphs and pictures of scrubbed and smiling workers with their sleeves rolled up. ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=1889))
        - **Note**: False 
    - the wise Party functionaries came to a decision: let the collective itself, the boys, censure the culprits. This was a piece of typical Soviet hypocrisy, designed to create an artificial simulacrum of public opinion and fake a unanimous vote of censure. ([Location 1923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=1923))
    - I peered inquisitively at their expressionless mugs. I was expecting to see cruelty, imperiousness, confidence, and willpower, but saw only stupidity. Stupidity and cowardice. ([Location 1946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=1946))
    - When you read or hear stories about the concentration camps, about the mass terror and millions of liquidated lives, no matter how vividly it strikes your imagination or arouses your sincere indignation and disgust, it all stays somehow on an abstract plane. It doesn’t change you personally in any way— ([Location 1972](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=1972))
        - **Note**: Abstraction 
    - owed not so much to Khrushchev as to A. V. Snegov.10 A close friend of Khrushchev in the old days, before the purges, Snegov himself had done time in a concentration camp; when Khrushchev came to power he let him out. Snegov had been a committed Communist and remained one, despite the camps, despite the terror he had lived through. This doesn’t surprise me. People of the older generation who remembered the days before Stalin did not equate the idea of communism with Stalin as we did. It seemed to them that if it hadn’t been for Stalin distorting Lenin’s beautiful concepts, everything would have been dandy. It ([Location 2010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2010))
    - Their rejection couldn’t go that deep. Some law of psychological self-preservation forced them to believe that only Stalin was guilty, not they. ([Location 2018](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2018))
    - man cannot, near the end of his life, acknowledge that the whole of it, and everything in which he believed, was a mistake, or even worse, a crime. ([Location 2019](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2019))
    - Snegov realized how unstable the situation was, and during the two years he was in the post, hastened to release as many prisoners as possible. By the time he was removed, only forty thousand or so were left in the camps. It was during this time that the ([Location 2025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2025))
    - mass terror was simply no longer possible—the ruling clique’s instinct for self-preservation had done the trick. ([Location 2038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2038))
    - carried out by three KGB investigators—one chief investigator and two assistants. One day when they were demanding that he name the enemies who had recruited him, he suddenly pointed his finger at the chief investigator and said: “You! It was you, you bastard, who recruited me! Don’t you remember? On maneuvers, outside Minsk, in 1933, in the birch grove!” “He’s raving, he’s gone mad, take him away!” said the chief investigator. “No, no, why do that?” said the other two with sudden interest. “It’s very interesting, let him go on.” He never saw that chief investigator again—he was probably shot. ([Location 2049](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2049))
    - The 1960s saw not so much a thaw as a cooling down, an ossification. ([Location 2062](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2062))
    - in place of the personality cult of the adored Stalin, people were given a personality cult of the hated Khrushchev. ([Location 2082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2082))
    - the political joke, a form of popular creation that is especially loved in the socialist countries, where people are deprived of information and a free press, and public opinion, banned and suppressed, finds expression in this form. Packed to the hilt with information, a Soviet joke is worth volumes of philosophical essays. The simplification of the joke exposes the absurdity of all propaganda tricks. The joke has survived the hardest times, stood its ground, multiplied into families of jokes, and in it you can study the entire history of the Soviet regime. It is as important to publish a complete collection of jokes as it is to write a true history of socialism. ([Location 2121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2121))
        - **Note**: Jokes
    - the more people tried to elucidate these unshakable Marxist principles, the more they became convinced that they didn’t exist, whereas what did exist led inexorably to Stalin. ([Location 2200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2200))
    - Formally speaking, the punitive measures taken against us were determined by the City Committee of the Komsomol and the Komsomol’s operational staff, but in fact it was the KGB. ([Location 2234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2234))
        - **Note**: Kgb
    - Sometimes the police punished us, but more often they simply let us go—their interdepartmental hatred for these self-appointed police officers from the KGB never abated. ([Location 2264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06XDSCM3B&location=2264))
        - **Note**: Police Hate kgb
    - On the first night, strangely enough, I slept soundly. It was a little odd to be sleeping without a sheet and directly under a blanket, which was all prickly. It was also uncomfortable sleeping with the light on, and like all novices on their first night in jail, I knocked on the door and naively asked them to put out the light. “Not allowed,” they replied through the door.
